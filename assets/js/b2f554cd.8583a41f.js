Maybe that\'s true.  \x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nToday I wanted to talk about what you can do with just one sensor.  Before we begin with that, I should give you some context.\\n\\n## ACTION & IoT\\n\\nFor as far back as I can remember, I\'ve been active.  Running, swimming, wrestling, lacrosse, and just being out in the wild moving through terrain.  Action has been the great restorative for me, both a source of daily joy and a catch net for times of depression.\\n\\nWe are the same in that way, you and I, because we are human.  Humans feel better when they move, when they physically work.  It\'s in our genes.  A bias for (thinking) action is part of what has made us the dominant species on the planet. \\n\\nOver the past few years as I\'ve gotten deeper into IoT, I have set aside much of my old action.  I call it \\"glueing my face to the computer\\", and while it has been intensely fascinating to dive into the world of IoT and LoRa and uplinks and routing, it has not been good for action.\\n\\nIn fact, with a few rare exceptions, like this helicopter delivery of a weather station to a mountain top:\\n\\n<video \\n  controls\\n  preload=\\"metadata\\"\\n  poster=\\"/img/blog/video-thumbnails/weather-station-delivery-thumb.png\\"\\n  style={{\\n    width: \'100%\',\\n    maxWidth: \'800px\',\\n    margin: \'20px auto\',\\n    borderRadius: \'8px\',\\n    border: \'4px solid var(--metsci-primary)\',\\n    boxShadow: \'0 4px 12px rgba(217, 74, 24, 0.15)\',\\n    backgroundColor: \'var(--metsci-white)\',\\n  }}\\n>\\n  <source src=\\"https://video.meteoscientific.com/helicopter-delivery-of-iot-weather-station-el-cajon-mtn.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\\n</video>\\n\\nor hiking in a giant 915 MHz antenna and half the accoutrements of a LoRaWAN gateway in a 70 lb pack on that same mountain range:\\n\\n<video \\n  controls\\n  preload=\\"metadata\\"\\n  poster=\\"/img/blog/video-thumbnails/giant-antenna-delivery-thumb.png\\"\\n  style={{\\n    width: \'100%\',\\n    maxWidth: \'800px\',\\n    margin: \'20px auto\',\\n    borderRadius: \'8px\',\\n    border: \'4px solid var(--metsci-primary)\',\\n    boxShadow: \'0 4px 12px rgba(217, 74, 24, 0.15)\',\\n    backgroundColor: \'var(--metsci-white)\',\\n  }}\\n>\\n  <source src=\\"https://video.meteoscientific.com/hiking-in-giant-lorawan-915-antenna.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\\n</video>\\n\\nIoT and real world human action seldom overlap.  One of the main selling points of IoT is that you actually do less action.  With a network of sensors, you can focus down to only doing the action that matters.\\n\\nIn one sense that\'s much more efficient, and certainly better for a business.  In the other, that brings us closer to death.  I\'m not ready to die yet, and so I sought a way to increase action with two caveats:\\n\\nFirst, I would do it with others.  I\'m no misanthrope, and while I\'ve had plenty of joyous times alone, there\'s something genetically satisfying about sharing physical effort with someone else.  It\'s (part) of what makes sex satisfying, but the joy of joint work is not solely the realm of procreation.\\n\\nA hard run with a friend, or a climb out of a deep canyon, or crossing a river, or just lifting weights with a group all trigger deep centers of joy.  We evolved to work together; it\'s how we brought down mammoths, kept the children safe, maintained and grew the tribe.\\n\\nTogether is how we best operate.\\n\\nSecond, I would involve IoT.  I love this tech; I think it\'s so cool the way we can start to measure the world, record it, and react to the world much faster, more accurately, and over far longer range than ever we could before.  IoT is so clearly the way forward for the way humans sense the world that ignoring it borders on the criminal.  \\n\\nStill, IoT is a dense thicket.  To use it you typically have to be able to do more than just make text bold or italic; there\'s code involved, hardware, software, connectivity, and more.  In fact, the deeper you get into IoT, the more that is required you know just to get something simple to work.\\n\\nHow then can we integrate the joy of action together with the barriers of getting something to actually work that surround IoT?\\n\\n## BEGINNINGS\\n\\nYears ago, when I was deep in my metal working phase, a buddy of mine came by to give me a couple of heavy iron elongated pyramids that looked like teeth off a robot T-rex.\\n\\n<div style={{\\n  display: \'flex\',\\n  justifyContent: \'center\',\\n  margin: \'20px auto\'\\n}}>\\n  <img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/2025-06-22-single-iot-sensor-power-the-sled/dredger_teeth.JPG\\"\\n    alt=\\"Heavy iron dredger teeth from San Diego bay dredger, looking like robot T-rex teeth\\"\\n    style={{\\n      maxWidth: \'800px\',\\n      width: \'100%\',\\n      borderRadius: \'8px\',\\n      border: \'4px solid var(--metsci-primary)\',\\n      boxShadow: \'0 4px 12px rgba(217, 74, 24, 0.15)\',\\n    }}\\n  />\\n</div>\\n\\nIn actual fact they were the worn out teeth of the San Diego bay dredger, the thing that digs out the bottom of the bay so it\'s deep enough for our various and sundry aircraft carriers, destroyers, and other large ships that dock here in America\'s Finest city and make up much of the US Pacific fleet.\\n\\nFor the longest time I didn\'t know what to do with \'em.  Then one day on the internet back in 2015-ish, I saw some football guys pushing a metal sled.\\n\\nAh, I thought, those dredger teeth would make excellent sled feet, and I could weld together my own heavy metal sled out of scrap I had laying around that I could push around the neighborhood causing all kinds of grinding-steel-on-concrete noise and generally be very pleased with myself as I bulldogged the thing around the block.\\n\\nSo I did.  I used it a few times because I love action, but other actions called in both real and virtual worlds, and the sled sat next to the weight rack until last Thursday.\\n\\nThrough a longer turn of events, I ended up pushing the sled to a buddy\'s house about \xbd a mile away as a workout and a challenge for him to push back.  \\n\\nHe did, and as I heard it grinding towards me on the street it hit me that I should share this idea, of pushing the sled between houses in a neighborhood, in a way that combined my love of action with my love of IoT, and the rapidly growing capabilities of vibe-coding (which just means working with AI to build something).\\n\\n## COORDINATION\\n \\nSo over the weekend I built a website to coordinate IoT action amongst strangers.  \\n\\nIt relies on the IoT device of a Digital Matter Oyster2, which is a slightly older piece of tech that is enormously stable and delivers on all the promises of IoT & LoRaWAN; long battery life, long communication range, and dead simple to use.\\n\\n<div style={{\\n  display: \'flex\',\\n  justifyContent: \'center\',\\n  margin: \'20px auto\'\\n}}>\\n  <img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/2025-06-22-single-iot-sensor-power-the-sled/oyster2-tracker-on-helium.JPG\\"\\n    alt=\\"Digital Matter Oyster2 IoT tracker device with Helium branding\\"\\n    style={{\\n      maxWidth: \'800px\',\\n      width: \'100%\',\\n      borderRadius: \'8px\',\\n      border: \'4px solid var(--metsci-primary)\',\\n      boxShadow: \'0 4px 12px rgba(217, 74, 24, 0.15)\',\\n    }}\\n  />\\n</div>\\n\\nThe Oyster is attached to the sled.  We added a wheels option so you can make it easier if needed, but most of the time the wheels are just mounted on that pin on the back.\\n\\n<div style={{\\n  display: \'flex\',\\n  justifyContent: \'center\',\\n  margin: \'20px auto\'\\n}}>\\n  <img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/2025-06-22-single-iot-sensor-power-the-sled/sled-with-tracker.jpg\\"\\n    alt=\\"The sled on delivery with the Oyster2 tracker mounted\\"\\n    style={{\\n      maxWidth: \'800px\',\\n      width: \'100%\',\\n      borderRadius: \'8px\',\\n      border: \'4px solid var(--metsci-primary)\',\\n      boxShadow: \'0 4px 12px rgba(217, 74, 24, 0.15)\',\\n    }}\\n  />\\n</div>\\n\\nWhen the sled is stationary for more than 7 minutes, the Oyster goes to sleep for 24 hours.  When the sled is moving, an accelerometer in the Oyster wakes the device up and it starts transmitting every 20 seconds.\\n\\n<video \\n  controls\\n  preload=\\"metadata\\"\\n  poster=\\"/img/blog/video-thumbnails/get-after-it-sled-pushing-thumb.png\\"\\n  style={{\\n    width: \'100%\',\\n    maxWidth: \'800px\',\\n    margin: \'20px auto\',\\n    borderRadius: \'8px\',\\n    border: \'4px solid var(--metsci-primary)\',\\n    boxShadow: \'0 4px 12px rgba(217, 74, 24, 0.15)\',\\n    backgroundColor: \'var(--metsci-white)\',\\n  }}\\n>\\n  <source src=\\"https://video.meteoscientific.com/sled-pushing-nik.mp4\\" type=\\"video/mp4\\" />\\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\\n</video>\\n\\n## Nerd Talk\\n\\nThe Oyster sends data packets via uplinks through the Helium Network to a LoRaWAN Network Server, or LNS.  In this case, we\'re using the MeteoScientific LNS Console. \\n\\nThe [MetSci Console](https://console.meteoscientific.com) is available for anyone to use, just sign up.  I\'ve written a whole series of [Tutorials](/docs/tutorial-basics/LoRaWAN-Big-Picture) on how to use it if you need help.  You get your first 400 data packets for free, and after they they cost $.0001 each.  Yeah, pretty cheap.\\n\\nThe LNS decodes the packets and sends them on via an http integration to a Cloudflare Worker.\\n\\nThe Worker puts the incoming packets from the Oyster into a Cloudflare D1 database.  It then reads that database and updates the website that coordinates and informs all the human actions.\\n\\n<div style={{\\n  display: \'flex\',\\n  justifyContent: \'center\',\\n  margin: \'20px auto\'\\n}}>\\n  <img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/2025-06-22-single-iot-sensor-power-the-sled/cloudflare-worker-bindings.png\\"\\n    alt=\\"Cloudflare Worker bindings showing connections to Assets, R2 bucket, D1 database, and KV namespace for intersections\\"\\n    style={{\\n      maxWidth: \'600px\',\\n      width: \'100%\',\\n      borderRadius: \'8px\',\\n      border: \'4px solid var(--metsci-primary)\',\\n      boxShadow: \'0 4px 12px rgba(217, 74, 24, 0.15)\',\\n    }}\\n  />\\n</div>\\n\\nAs I\'ve said, Action is one of my loves.\\n\\nYou can go to the website to see how the rest of it works, but before I send you there, let me walk you through the general workflow.\\n\\n## The Real World\\n\\nLet\'s say you\'re a reasonably fit person out walking your dog.  If, like me, you want to work out with other people but joining a gym isn\'t your thing, you might be interested in a flyer you see on a telephone pole that says \\"Hard Work - Sled Pushing\\"\\n\\n<div style={{\\n  display: \'flex\',\\n  justifyContent: \'center\',\\n  margin: \'20px auto\'\\n}}>\\n  <img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/2025-06-22-single-iot-sensor-power-the-sled/sled-pushing-flyer.JPG\\"\\n    alt=\\"Flyer for sled pushing signup in Normal Heights, San Diego California\\"\\n    style={{\\n      maxWidth: \'600px\',\\n      width: \'100%\',\\n      borderRadius: \'8px\',\\n      border: \'4px solid var(--metsci-primary)\',\\n      boxShadow: \'0 4px 12px rgba(217, 74, 24, 0.15)\',\\n    }}\\n  />\\n</div>\\n\\nYou tear off one of the tabs at the bottom which has a QR code and 5 or 6 character password and take it home.\\n\\nYou scan the QR code and find the site, read through the description, and decide to sign up.\\n\\nThe very short version of the description is that you\'re signing up for a heavy metal sled to be pushed to you by a stranger, then you\'re responsible for \\"delivering\\" (by pushing) the sled to the next stranger.  \\n\\nThe distances are bounded by 300 and 1,000 meters so that the push will be neither too long nor short, and the general rules (during the day, of course you can bring a friend, contact me if anything goes wrong) are laid out.\\n\\nWhen you sign up, you enter your email, the handle you want to go by publicly, your address, and the password you entered.\\n\\n### A Quick Revisit of Nerdville\\n\\nThe Cloudflare Worker receives that information and uses the Haversine formula to calculate both your address latitude and longitude.  It then runs your coordinates through a Cloudflare KV pair of every intersection in the neighborhood so it can give others a general idea of where you are without giving away your address (i.e. \\"Nik near 35th and Copley just signed up\\").\\n\\nThe Worker puts all that data into a Cloudflare D1 table.  Once you\'re in the table, the Worker figures out where you should go in the sled delivery queue.\\n\\n## The Feedback Loop\\n\\nYou can see where you are in the queue on the website, and when the pusher before you starts their push (calculated by the Oyster recording movement outside of a 15 meter radius from the pusher\'s address), the Worker fires off an email via Mailgun telling you the sled is coming.\\n\\nWhen the sled enters the 15 meter radius around your address, you\'ll get another email confirming that the sled has been dropped off and giving you the address of where you\'ll push to.\\n\\nThis continues on for as long as people sign up; at the end of the queue it just loops back to the beginning.\\n\\n## Making The Map\\n\\nAll of this information about location is displayed on a PMTiles map I generated after downlaading an 80GB map of the entire world and processing out just my little neighborhood using a local machine I call Monstra for the processing (3 x 4070 Super Ti GPUs and a Threadripper). \\n\\n<div style={{\\n  display: \'flex\',\\n  justifyContent: \'center\',\\n  margin: \'20px auto\'\\n}}>\\n  <img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/2025-06-22-single-iot-sensor-power-the-sled/monstra-gpu-and-threadripper-local-ai.jpg\\"\\n    alt=\\"Triple GPU machine with Threadripper for running local LLM and AI tasks\\"\\n    style={{\\n      maxWidth: \'600px\',\\n      width: \'100%\',\\n      borderRadius: \'8px\',\\n      border: \'4px solid var(--metsci-primary)\',\\n      boxShadow: \'0 4px 12px rgba(217, 74, 24, 0.15)\',\\n    }}\\n  />\\n</div>\\n\\nThe PMTiles map is stored in a Cloudflare R2 and displayed on the site, with the live tracker of the sled on it:\\n\\n<div style={{\\n  display: \'flex\',\\n  justifyContent: \'center\',\\n  margin: \'20px auto\'\\n}}>\\n  <img \\n    src=\\"/img/blog/2025-06-22-single-iot-sensor-power-the-sled/sled-tracking-map.png\\"\\n    alt=\\"The displayed PMTiles map I built with Monstra\\"\\n    style={{\\n      maxWidth: \'600px\',\\n      width: \'100%\',\\n      borderRadius: \'8px\',\\n      border: \'4px solid var(--metsci-primary)\',\\n      boxShadow: \'0 4px 12px rgba(217, 74, 24, 0.15)\',\\n    }}\\n  />\\n</div>\\n\\nSo that\'s the combination of nerd workflow and action.\\n\\n## The Next Steps\\n\\nIf you\'re in our little neighborhood of Normal Heights, you can [sign up to have the sled \\"delivered\\" to you](https://sled.meteoscientific.com), and then you\'ll be on the hook to deliver it to the next person.\\n\xa0\\nAs more people sign up, we get two very important things.  \\n\\nFirst, we combine IoT and Action, which is a source of deep joy for me.  Every person that participates is using IoT, and many of them will learn just a little bit more about how they\'re using it just from interacting with the sled website.  I try to answer their questions up front in the [Sled FAQ section](https://sled.meteoscientific.com/faq)) on the sled site; that way they\'re not afraid to ask.\\n\\nSecond, I get to connect with the section of all the people in my neighborhood (about 5,000 families total according to US Census statistic) who are willing to engage in a string of hot and sweaty deliveries from and to a stranger.  I\'ve got the feeling they\'ll be my kind of people.\\n\\nThere is one other aspect of this one-sensor project that\'s pretty cool; this system is repeatable and cheap.  \\n\\nIt runs entirely on the free tiers of Cloudflare Workers, D1, R2, and KV. It\'s all in a Github repo that I\'d be happy to share, though I\'ll warn you that the Worker is messy and for now, it\'ll be a bit than just \\"copy/paste\\" to get it going.\\n\\nThe only cost is the tracking device.  The Oyster2 is (generally) no longer sold, but you can get the next gen Oyster3 that runs about $130.  I\'d recommend getting one from [LoneStar Tracking](https://www.lonestartracking.com/tracking-devices/oyster-lora-gps-tracking-device-915mhz/).  That\'s where I got my Oyster, and Tommy at LoneStar is good people.\\n\\nYou could get creative here and find a device that gathers more than just GPS data; say, air quality, or temperature, etc. and display that as well.\\n\\nYou may have read this and thought this is all too much, and there\'s some aspect of it that you just couldn\'t do.\\n\\n## Yes, You Can\\n\\nIf you\'ve read this far, you absolutely have the two critical things required to make a project work; the **focus to read** and the **curiosity to keep going**.  Everything else is just action, and humans are built for action!\\n\\nThose two things are all anyone needs to succeed in the world of IoT, which is, after all, the thing that will change our world.\\n\\nWith those two things and one sensor, you too can expand a new truth about IoT.\\n\\nWhat\'ll your one-sensor project be?\\n\\n:::info Author\\n\\n**Nik Hawks** is a LoRaWAN Educator & Builder at [MeteoScientific](https://meteoscientific.com/).

Not enough people know about LPWANs, let alone LoRaWAN.  What does that mean for you, the business owner who is deploying LoRaWAN to service clients?\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n*This is for anyone exploring or deploying LoRaWAN as part of a business solution\u2014whether you\u2019re an integrator building out a product, a founder launching a sensor-powered service, or a company exploring IoT for compliance, energy savings, or smarter operations.*\\n\\n### Start With A Problem\\n\\nAs Rish Chauhan, head of Business Development at [TTN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) says, you have to \u201cstart with a problem.\u201d\\n\\nIt\u2019s not magic; that\u2019s the whole purpose of a business: To solve somebody else\u2019s problems.  \\n\\nPeople buy cars to solve the problem of getting to work or the grocery store or the gym.  They don\u2019t need to know how an alternator works, or whether or not there\u2019s an M20B25 or 27 engine in a 1979 BMW 320i.  The car gets them to work; they don\u2019t care exactly how it does it.\\n\\nThat\u2019s something those of us in the LoRaWAN world can forget.  We spend a lot of time geeking out on the fascinating tech of it, but as Andy Humphrey over at [Harmony Analytica](https://harmonyanalytica.com/) says:\\n\\n> What the customer wants is what matters. You\'re serving the customer, not your tech desires.\\n\\nOnce you\u2019ve solved their problem, THEN you can start talking about how you solved it, and let that lead into solving even more problems.  This is Humphrey\u2019s **land and expand** strategy, where you land with one solution, then start going sideways to introduce more sensor types.\\n\\nNow, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to  start with just one sensor.  Bansi at the firm [Macnman](https://www.macnman.com/) recommends starting with at least 100 sensors as the sweet spot for getting enough data and justifying the infrastructure cost.  [In his podcast episode](https://pod.metsci.show/episode/from-handfuls-to-hundreds-bansi-talks-scale) he gives the smoke detector example. \\n\\nThink of how much you can cover with one LoRaWAN enabled smoke detector in a ten story building vs multiple LoRaWAN smoke alarms on each floor.  One is cute, the other saves lives and machinery.  \\n\\nStarting focused doesn\u2019t necessarily mean to start small.\\n\\nFinally, you may not know what problems they have when you go in; maybe you\'re walking in cold, or you just bumped into someone at the coffee shop.  [Scott Andrews](https://www.senseability.uk/), whose LoRaWAN work spans both the public and private sector advises you to just ask:  \\"Ask about their machines and what they do and how they work.\\"\\n\\nAwareness may be the number one threat facing LoRaWAN, but in the course of the 15 conversations I\u2019ve had in the past few weeks starting up [The Business of LoRaWAN podcast](https://pod.metsci.show/), the business side faces other challenges, among them how complicated it can be for non-engineers to use.\\n\\n\\n### Make It Easy\\n\\nThis is the difference between encouraging small business owners to deploy their own networks and coming in as a full stack integrator; one has the problem but struggles with the solution.  The other has the solution and needs to find the problem.  \\n\\nOne happy middle ground is to make using LoRaWAN a lot easier by designing for beginners.\\n\\nThat\u2019s what Slaven Damjanovic at [GLAMOS](https://glamos.eu/) has done with his LoRaWAN field tester.  Slaven started GLAMOS just before Helium introduced LoRaWAN to a few hundred thousand people over the course of about 9 months.  \\n\\nThe LoRaWAN field testers he was producing HAD to be beginner friendly; most of the new Helium entrants had never heard of LoRaWAN.  They wanted to know what coverage was like in their area, and it need to be push-button easy.\\n\\nThe easier it is for someone to use a system, whether it\u2019s a field test device like the GLAMOS or a soil moisture sensor, the better.  In fact, by making a device much easier to use you can increase the value of the thing, something that that Harmony Analytica does with their soil moisture sensor.  \\n\\nSure, you can order a [MakerFabs soil moisture sensor from Robot Shop](https://www.robotshop.com/products/makerfabs-lorawan-temperature-humidity-soil-moisture-sensor-915mhz?) for $20 and even 3D print a [cool little housing](https://www.printables.com/model/421370-makerfabs-soil-moisture-sensor-lorawan-housing) for it, but then you have to program it, protect it from the elements (and lawnmowers), ruggedize it, then display its data or better yet, use the data to solve a problem.  \\n\\nAll of those are value-add steps that Harmony Analytica offers in its $200 soil moisture sensor custom designed for the vertical of busy irrigation professionals.\\n\\n### Leverage The Strengths\\n\\nWe tend to forget about how good LoRaWAN is at solving certain problems, one of which is making almost anything, from sensor to skyscraper, smarter.  \\n\\nManoj Telrandhe at [TerraQ](https://www.terraq.tech/) does a great job highlighting this, and it has nothing to do with managing uplinks or what spreading factor was used; it\'s how much area one gateway can cover.\\n\\nTerraQ deploys sensors throughout restaurants, adding HVAC monitoring, energy management (where he has a long history), and food compliance safety reporting.  As these restaurants expand, whether it\u2019s knocking down a wall to make their space bigger or shifting down the street, adding a new sensor is as easy as putting in the batteries and sticking it on the wall (or the equipment.)\\n\\nA LoRaWAN gateway can cover a huge area, so once you get that first gateway in, you\u2019ve opened the door for up to 2,000 more sensors to deploy.  This is a massive advantage of LoRaWAN, and leaning into that wide area coverage should be on your business expansion checklist with any client.  You\u2019ve got the coverage; why not use it?\\n\\nThe first and biggest cost is getting that gateway and first sensors installed; once it\u2019s there, adding more sensors should be positioned as speeding up ROI. As Dean Marsh at [UK Connect](https://www.ukconnect.com/) says: \\n\\n> You\u2019ve got to speak the language of ROI to the customer.\\n\\n### Be Unafraid to Roam\\n\\nSince LoRaWAN is a wide area network, the chances are good that wherever you deploy, there\u2019s already coverage there from another network.  Ignoring this can cost you and your clients money, which slows down ROI; never a good thing.\\n\\nTest what\u2019s available on site and don\u2019t be afraid to figure out roaming agreements with other providers.  The most pervasive and easiest network to use (completely permissionless) will probably be Helium, a global community network with [coverage across most of the developed world](https://world.helium.com/en/iot/coverage).  \\n\\nSign up for a free [MeteoScientific Console account](https://console.meteoscientific.com/front/login) and carry a field tester with you to your next potential client to test it out.  You get your first 400 Data Credits (24 byte each) for free, and I think you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised with the coverage.\\n\\nThis can make for a great demo to not have to set up a gateway.\\n\\n> Here\u2019s your sensor, here\u2019s your data.  Do you want this on a consistent basis?  \\n\\nFrom there you can provide your own gateways as needed to fill in the gaps, using [Paul Pinault\u2019s](https://www.disk91.com/) strategy of using a hybrid network approach to reduce downtime, increase reliability, and maximize ROI while maintaining control over data and encryption.\\n\\nAs Robert Bogs says of his deployment project [Kayna-Funkt](https://kayna-funkt.de/), \\"With IoT you can have immediate impacts.\\"  What more immediate impact than showing a business owner their data before you charge them anything?\\n\\nHowever you use LoRaWAN, incorporating these 4 aspects will help you build your LoRaWAN business faster, better, and stronger.\\n - Start with a problem\\n - Make it easy\\n - Leverage the strengths\\n - Be unafraid to roam\\n\\nHere\'s to you getting out there and gettin\' after it, crushing sensor deployments, making the world a better, smarter place, and helping solve the number one problem in LoRaWAN.\\n\\nGet \'em, friends!\\n\\n:::info Author\\n\\n**Nik Hawks** is a LoRaWAN Educator & Builder at [MeteoScientific](https://meteoscientific.com/).

One of those is the [Helium network](https://world.helium.com/en/iot/hotspots), a global LoRaWAN.  \\n\\nWe\u2019ll take a look at how to assess whether or not there is already Helium coverage in your area, and if it\u2019s acceptable for your project. Let\u2019s start at their coverage map, found at [`world.helium.com`](https://world.helium.com/en/mobile), which will default to Mobile.\\n\\n![Helium World Mobile Map](/img/blog/2025-04-27-lets-explore-helium-explorer/world-helium-mobile.png)\\n\\nHelium has 2 networks.  One is for IoT, and one is for phones.  We\u2019re going to focus on the IoT network, which is the largest LoRaWAN network in the world with over 250,000 LoRaWAN gateways.  \\n\\nHelium calls these gateways \u201cHotspots\u201d in an attempt to make this technology relatable to the average person.  I\u2019ll use \u201cgateway\u201d and \u201chotspot\u201d interchangeably here.\\n\\n### The Hotspot Map\\n\\nWe\u2019ll start by exploring the Hotspot map, which you can find by [going to the green IoT button on the Helium IoT Explorer](https://world.helium.com/en/iot/hotspots), then clicking it to get dropdown options and selecting \u201cHotspot Map\u201d.\\n\\n![Choose IoT Explorer](/img/blog/2025-04-27-lets-explore-helium-explorer/chose-green-iot-then-hotspot-map.png)\\n\\nYou should easily recognize the basic stats, like number of Hotspots and Daily Messages, but \u201cDC burned\u201d may be new to you.  \\n\\n![Helium IoT Basic Stats](/img/blog/2025-04-27-lets-explore-helium-explorer/helium-basic-stats.png)\\n\\nHelium is a network powered by cryptocurrency.  The currency, or token, is called an HNT, or Helium Network Token.  It is used to [pay for data credits, or DCs, which allow you to transfer on the network](https://docs.helium.com/tokens/data-credit/).\\n\\n\\nIf you\u2019d like, **you can skip the whole cryptocurrency thing** and just buy DCs with whatever currency you\u2019re used to; dollars, euros, yen, whatever.  If you\'d like to try that, you can do it over on the [MeteoScientific Console](https://console.meteoscientific.com/front/login), although I give you the first 400 DC for free. \\n\\n### The Cost Of Using The Helium Network\\n\\nOne DC covers up to a 24 byte message and equals `$0.00001` USD.  Yes, that\u2019s a thousandth of a penny.  Over on the MetSci Console (one of many LNS on Helium) I charge a 10x premium, which means you can still run a sensor sending **a packet an hour for a year and spend less than a dollar.**\\n\\nIf you\u2019re sending less than 24 bytes you still get charged for all 24.  If you\u2019re sending more, you\u2019ll get charged multiple DC per message.\\n\\nYou could also buy multiple copies of that message from multiple gateways.\\n\\nUnlike traditional wireless networks, there is no subscription fee.  You just pay for the data you successfully transfer.\\n\\nHelium is a permissionless network; there\u2019s no sales staff to talk to first if you want to use it, no crazy sign up process, and if you\u2019ve ever used LoRaWAN before, not much new to learn; you can just use it.  If you need help, check out my [tutorials](https://www.meteoscientific.com/docs/tutorial-basics/LoRaWAN-Big-Picture).\\n\\nAs you can see, Helium is staggeringly transparent.  On April 27th 2025 when I wrote this, 6.3 million messages had been transferred across the network in the last 24 hours at a cost of 10.4 million DC, or $104.81.\\n\\n![Transparent Data on Helium](/img/blog/2025-04-27-lets-explore-helium-explorer/staggeringly-transparent-costs.png)\\n\\nYou can also see how many Hotspots (gateways) are currently serving the network, about 287,000 as of the time of writing.  If we just do some fast back-of-the-envelope math, you can see that what Helium did using token incentives to build a global LoRaWAN could not have been done in any traditional way.  \\n\\nIf we price a gateway at $100 to buy and deploy, which is on the (very) cheap side, it would have cost a traditional network builder $28,740,000 to deploy today\u2019s network.  Not every company has a cool $27 million to roll out a network.\\n\\nThat number, by the way, will probably shrink over time, stabilizing at (my GUESS) about 150,000 active gateways at any given time, probably providing the same coverage as you currently see with less redundancy.  \\n\\n:::note\\nThe reasons for the network\'s changing size go well beyond the scope of this article; if we meet for a coffee sometime I\'ll walk you through the whole arc of growth and all the deets.  For now, let\'s stick with exploring coverage.\\n:::\\n\\nThe ongoing maintenance for gateways on the network is paid for by the people who deployed them, just like any network.  Many are run off their provided internet, but some (including some of mine) are on mountain tops and require a cell backhaul.  \\n\\nThose are ongoing costs borne by those who either want to earn cryptocurrency by adding something to their home network as well as those who, like me, use the network every day to pull in IoT data about my world, from weather stations to rain tank gauges to soil moisture.\\n\\nOf course, you might zoom in on an area that doesn\u2019t have a gateway and you want coverage there.  You can always deploy your own.  LoRaWAN gateways can be onboarded onto the Helium network, or you can buy a pre-onboarded one from a manufacturer like [RAK Wireless](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/rak-hotspot-v2-with-free-rak2270-sticker-the-ultimate-tracking-bundle?variant=43023959523526) and deploy it, in which case you\u2019ll be able to use your coverage AND earn a little cryptocurrency.\\n\\nThat leads us to the Coverage map, which you\u2019ll find by going to the green IoT tab at the top right, clicking on it to get the dropdown, and selecting \u201cCoverage Map\u201d.\\n\\n![Coverage Explorer on Helium](/img/blog/2025-04-27-lets-explore-helium-explorer/helium-coverage-map.png)\\n\\n### What Does a Gateway Cover?\\n\\nOn the `IoT` --\x3e `Hotspot Map`, you can look for a specific Hotspot if you know its name. For example, `Quick Red Cobra` is one in downtown San Diego California, where I live.  Hotspots are assigned three-word names (Adjective-Color-Animal) randomly when they join the network.  This makes it easier for non-technical people to remember (and refer to) their hotspot.  Not everyone likes calling \'em a `UG56` or `SX1302 based` or the ol\' `LPS8N`.\\n\\nLet\u2019s take a look at Quick Red Cobra and see what we can learn about the coverage this one gateway provides.\\n\\n![Quick Red Cobra Helium Hotspot](/img/blog/2025-04-27-lets-explore-helium-explorer/quick-red-cobra.png)\\n\\nThe first thing you\'ll probably notice is all the green hexes.  Helium uses the Uber h3 hex system to map out coverage, focusing on the resolution 8, or `res 8` sized hex, which is about .73 square kilometers.  \\n\\nUber has written about this system extensively and open sourced it; you can [learn more about it here](https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/).\\n\\nThe very short version is that a hexagonal shape does a great job of consistently mapping a globe like our planet.  Using different size hexes allows you to map out an area of the world in any level of detail.\\n\\nThe sizes, or \\"resolutions\\", range from a `res 0` hex, of which there are only 110 in the world, each covering about 4.3 million square kilometers, all the way down to a `res 15` which has over 569 billion hexagons and maps to just under a square meter.\\n\\nIf you want to check out all the res sizes, [here\u2019s the list](https://h3geo.org/docs/core-library/restable).\\n\\nIf it\u2019s good enough for Uber to find you at the airport among the other hundred people waiting in the rideshare lot, it\'s good enough to provide an excellent map of coverage for a LoRaWAN.\\n\\nEvery hotspot (or gateway, as you like) will cover a given number of `res 8` hexes.  Using the current coverage calculator, the Helium Explorer estimates that Quick Red Cobra has an expected coverage range of 500 hexes with at least a -130 dBm signal.  Not bad! \\n\\n![Quick Red Cobra Hexes covered](/img/blog/2025-04-27-lets-explore-helium-explorer/quick-red-cobra-hexes-covered.png)\\n\\nHow do you know a hex is covered?  \\n\\nYou can use three methods; the easy way, the paid way, or the DIY way.\\n\\n#### The Easy Way To Check Coverage\\n\\nThe easy way is to just look at what\u2019s reported on this image.  In this case, the hotspot Quick Red Cobra has received data from 500 hexes.  This reported coverage data comes from a project called DIMO, which sells a vehicle data device called a Macaron that transmits information about a vehicle gathered from its OBD port via the Helium LoRaWAN.\\n\\nIf a vehicle with a DIMO Macaron has transmitted data from a hex covered by a gateway, that hex will show you the coverage strength and what gateways received the data.  \\n\\n#### The Paid Way to Check Coverage\\n\\nThe paid way is to use your own device, like a [GLAMOS mapper](https://glamos.eu/).  You\'d use your GLAMOS (or any mapper) to map a specific location, then assess the readings from your device using the GLAMOS app.\\n\\n#### The DIY Way to Check Coverage\\n\\nThe DIY way is to build your own mapping solution.  That\'s fun and rewarding, but for most instances, especially in the developed world where a ton of Hotspots are already deployed with plenty of DIMO vehicle traffic to map out signal, the Helium Coverage map is good enough, or for places where you\'re not sure (or need specific indoor coverage) the GLAMOS app fills in any gaps.\\n\\n### What About Coverage...HERE?\\n\\nNow, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re more interested in actual coverage than which gateway is providing it.  For that, you can go [back to the coverage map](https://world.helium.com/en/iot/coverage) and zoom in on any given area.\\n\\n![Grenoble Helium Coverage](/img/blog/2025-04-27-lets-explore-helium-explorer/grenoble-helium-coverage.png)\\n\\nWe\u2019ll use the town of Grenoble in France for our example. I\u2019ve zoomed in to it, and clicked on one of the green hexes in the Les Charmettes area.  \\n\\nHere we can see that 17 gateways provide coverage at better than -130 dBM for this hex, with a best RSSI of -83 dBm.\\n\\n![17 Gateways In Grenoble](/img/blog/2025-04-27-lets-explore-helium-explorer/17-gateways-in-grenoble.png)\\n\\nIf you have specific dBm requirements, you can use the slider at the bottom right of the screen to set those.  For example, with a minimum RSSI of -108 dBm our redundancy drops to 9 gateways.  This is pretty much what I\u2019d expect in the birthplace of LoRa; excellent coverage all around town.\\n\\nNow, a global network does not equal ubiquitous coverage, and you\u2019ll notice plenty of spots on the map where no coverage has been recorded.\\n\\nIf you need coverage in the mountains, or anywhere a vehicle can\u2019t go, you can always grab any LoRaWAN device and fire off a few packets, or use the GLAMOS app, or buy a Helium Mapper from [RAK](https://store.rakwireless.com/products/field-mapper-for-helium-with-plug-play-and-3rd-party-mode-rak10701-h?variant=43920609444038) or [Seeed](https://www.seeedstudio.com/WioField-Tester-Kit-p-5282.html) to see what specific coverage is like. \\n\\n![Helium Field Mappers](/img/blog/2025-04-27-lets-explore-helium-explorer/helium-mappers.png)\\n\\nYou can also build your own Mapper [following instructions](https://docs.helium.com/iot/coverage-mapping/quickstart) over on the Helium Docs site. \\n\\nThat wraps it for how to assess LoRaWAN coverage for anywhere in the world on the Helium network.  If you\u2019d like to see coverage on other networks, excellent websites like [Coverage Map](https://www.coveragemap.net/) offer maps of [TTN](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) and other networks.  \\n\\nNot every LoRaWAN offers public mapping information like this (many of them have their own internal tools to manage and monitor their private networks), but if you\u2019re looking for an easy way to see if there\u2019s the kind of LoRaWAN coverage you need for your IoT solution, the Helium World Explorer is an excellent place to start.\\n\\nHappy coverage hunting!\\n\\n:::info Author\\n\\n**Nik Hawks** is a LoRaWAN Educator & Builder at [MeteoScientific](https://meteoscientific.com/).

For example, **1 CCF** of wasted water in NYC (~748 gallons) costs a business ~$12 in water/sewer charges ([Rates & Regulations - Water Board](https://www.nyc.gov/site/nycwaterboard/rates/rates-regulations.page#:~:text=2025%207%2F1%2F24,33)); in LA, closer to $15. \\n\\nEvery **1,000 kWh** of unnecessary electrical usage in California costs ~$182; in New York ~$177; even in cheaper Illinois it\u2019s ~$115. These recurring expenses establish a strong baseline for IoT savings potential.\\n\\n## When Does IoT Make Financial Sense? (Thresholds by Size)\\n\\nIoT implementations require upfront investment (sensors, devices, software integration), so a common question is: **at what point (in building size or headcount) do the savings justify the cost?** Key factors include the building\u2019s square footage, occupancy, and baseline utility consumption:\\n\\n- **Building Size Threshold:** Large facilities tend to waste more absolute energy/water, making IoT controls more immediately cost-effective. Traditionally, **buildings larger than 50,000 sq ft** were the domain of full Building Management Systems (BMS). \\n\\nIn fact, over [90% of U.S. commercial buildings under 50k sq ft lack a proper BMS](https://buildings.honeywell.com/content/dam/hbtbt/en/documents/downloads/Small%20and%20medium%20buildings_WHP-21-12-2022.pdf) to manage energy, even though the **average commercial building wastes ~30%** of the energy it consumes. \\n\\nIoT now bridges this gap by offering \u201clighter\u201d solutions suitable for **smaller buildings**. Modern IoT-based systems are **wireless and modular**, [avoiding the high CAPEX of traditional BMS](https://zenatix.com/how-is-iot-enabling-energy-savings-with-quick-roi/#:~:text=On%20the%20one%20hand%2C%20traditional,effectiveness%20and%20ease%20of%20deployment). This means **even buildings less than 50k sq ft or with modest staff** can achieve ROI, whereas before they couldn\u2019t justify a full-scale automation system.\\n\\n**Headcount and Usage:** More employees typically mean more devices, lighting, HVAC load, and water use (restrooms, etc.). However, headcount correlates imperfectly with usage \u2013 **square footage and operating hours are better metrics.** \\n\\nFor example, a **10,000 sq ft retail store** with 5 employees open 90 hours a week may use far more energy than a **20,000 sq ft office** with 50 employees that operates 40 hours a week. **IoT becomes compelling when a business\u2019s annual utility bills are high enough that a 10\u201320% savings offsets IoT project costs within a few years.** \\n\\nIn practice, many find this threshold at roughly **$50,000+ in annual utility spend**, which could correspond to a ~**20,000+ sq ft office** or a **50,000 sq ft retail** building ([depending on usage intensity](https://www.costanalysts.com/average-retail-electric-bill/#:~:text=Example%3A)) . At that point, even a modest percentage savings translates to thousands of dollars.\\n\\n:::note\\nAn average U.S. retail building uses ~14.3 kWh electricity and 30.9 cubic feet of gas per square foot yearly ([Average Electric Cost for Retail Store](https://www.costanalysts.com/average-retail-electric-bill/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Energy%20Information,the%20climate%20they%20operate%20in)). \\n:::\\n\\nThat equates to about **$1.76 per sq ft per year** in energy costs ([using national average $1.47 for electricity + $0.29 for gas](https://www.costanalysts.com/average-retail-electric-bill)). A **50,000 sq ft retail store** spends roughly **$90,000/year on energy**.

They also use large volumes of water for guest rooms (showers, toilets), laundry, pools, etc., all of which then require sewer treatment.\\n\\n**Costs:** Utilities can account for 4\u20136% of a hotel\u2019s operating costs or more. Using the above usage figures, a **100,000 sq ft hotel** (around ~150 rooms, 4 floors) might use ~1.4 million kWh and 4.9 million cubic ft of gas annually. \\n\\nAt California rates (~18\xa2/kWh, ~$1/therm), that\u2019s on the order of **$300k+ per year** in energy costs. Water/sewer bills in a large hotel can also be hefty (millions of gallons per year). This high baseline means **even single-digit percentage improvements** yield big dollar savings.\\n\\n**IoT Opportunities:** Hotels benefit greatly from **smart HVAC and occupancy-based controls**. Guestrooms are often unoccupied for large parts of the day \u2013 IoT occupancy sensors and smart thermostats can set back temperature setpoints when rooms are empty or guests are asleep, without compromising comfort. \\n\\nSmart hotel thermostats and integrated energy management systems (EMS) have proven especially effective: they **continuously analyze thermal behavior, weather, and peak loads to optimize HVAC in real-time** ([](http://verdant.copeland.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Increasing-Profitability-with-IoT-Technology.pdf#:~:text=While%20smart%20thermostats%20and%20occupancy,6%2C%20and%20generate%20some%20of)) ([](http://verdant.copeland.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Increasing-Profitability-with-IoT-Technology.pdf#:~:text=IoT%20energy%20savings%2C%20moreover%2C%20are,Other%20HVAC%20devices%20Water%20consumption)). IoT leak sensors on pipes and fixtures can catch running toilets or drips that would otherwise go unnoticed (important for water conservation). \\n\\nCommon area lighting, pool pumps, and even kitchen equipment can be IoT-scheduled or monitored for efficiency. Hotels also leverage IoT for **predictive maintenance** \u2013 e.g. sensing when a chiller or boiler is losing efficiency and needs tune-up, avoiding energy waste and downtime.\\n\\n**Savings & ROI:** The potential is dramatic. Smart energy management systems (like Verdant\u2019s hotel IoT solution) **can reduce hotel energy costs by up to 20%** ([](http://verdant.copeland.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Increasing-Profitability-with-IoT-Technology.pdf#:~:text=EI,Verdant%20Energy%20Management%20Thermostats%20Lightning)).

Another analysis by Schneider Electric\u2019s Zenatix notes that IoT-based building solutions often achieve **ROI in 12\u201318 months**, whereas older BMS took 3\u20135 years ([How is IoT enabling energy savings with quick ROI? - Zenatix by Schneider Electric](https://zenatix.com/how-is-iot-enabling-energy-savings-with-quick-roi/#:~:text=periods%20%2812,5%20years)). Beyond energy, water savings (from detecting leaks or optimizing laundry cycles) can add to the ROI \u2013 and in cities with Tiered water rates or fines for overuse, avoiding waste has direct payback. \\n\\nIn many cases, large hotels see annual savings in the six figures, meaning IoT investments can pay for themselves in **well under 2 years** and then continue saving money long-term.\\n\\n### Offices (Corporate and Commercial Office Buildings)\\n\\n**Usage Profile:** Office buildings primarily use electricity for lighting, computers, and HVAC, and use natural gas or steam for heating. Occupancy is typically 8\u201312 hours on weekdays, with off-hours presenting big savings opportunities. \\n\\nEnergy use intensity for offices averages **15\u201322 kWh per sq ft/year** (lower for small offices ~13 kWh, higher for large offices ~20 kWh) ([Small and Midsize Offices - Orlando Utilities Commission](https://esource.bizenergyadvisor.com/article/small-and-midsize-offices#:~:text=Small%20and%20Midsize%20Offices%20,of%20electricity)) ([How Much Power Does An Office Building Use? - Remote Fill Systems](https://remotefillsystems.com/how-much-power-does-an-office-building-use/#:~:text=Systems%20remotefillsystems,annually%20by%20large%20office%20buildings)), plus heating fuel.

For example, an AI-based HVAC optimization in an office portfolio can yield ~30% savings with ROI under 3 years ([Smart Building - IOT solutions - Ewattch](https://ewattch.com/en/solutions/solution-energetique-batiments-tertiaires/#:~:text=Smart%20Building%20,Start%20your)), and some IoT providers advertise ROI less than **3 months** for certain optimizations in commercial buildings ([Smart Building - IOT solutions - Ewattch](https://ewattch.com/en/solutions/solution-energetique-batiments-tertiaires/#:~:text=Smart%20Building%20,Start%20your)) (likely in very wasteful pre-IoT scenarios). \\n\\nEven **small offices** benefit: cloud-based IoT building platforms are allowing small/medium offices to get **BMS-like savings (20\u201330% cuts) at a fraction of the cost** ([How is IoT enabling energy savings with quick ROI? - Zenatix by Schneider Electric](https://zenatix.com/how-is-iot-enabling-energy-savings-with-quick-roi/#:~:text=2,buildings%2C%20ignoring%20the%20small%20infrastructures)) ([How is IoT enabling energy savings with quick ROI? - Zenatix by Schneider Electric](https://zenatix.com/how-is-iot-enabling-energy-savings-with-quick-roi/#:~:text=,energy%20savings)). \\n\\nOne whitepaper noted a small office pilot that **achieved 29% energy savings in under 3 months** using an IoT retrofit ([Small & Medium Buildings Report | Honeywell](https://buildings.honeywell.com/content/dam/hbtbt/en/documents/downloads/Small%20and%20medium%20buildings_WHP-21-12-2022.pdf#:~:text=Achieved%2029,an%20average%20of%204%2C273%20kilowatt)). The **bottom line for offices** is that IoT not only pays for itself but often contributes to significant operational cost reduction, improved occupant comfort (which can indirectly boost productivity), and even higher property value \u2013 efficient buildings command higher rents and asset values ([Impact of Energy and Water Savings on Multifamily Properties | WegoWise](https://www.wegowise.com/resources/financial-impact-of-energy-and-water-savings#:~:text=,property%20to%20an%20entire%20portfolio)) ([Impact of Energy and Water Savings on Multifamily Properties | WegoWise](https://www.wegowise.com/resources/financial-impact-of-energy-and-water-savings#:~:text=Energy%20and%20water%20benchmarking%20and,a%20fast%20time%20to%20value)).\\n\\n## Other Industries with Strong IoT Justification\\n\\nWhile retail, hospitality, and offices are prime candidates, **many other industries** also see exceptional ROI from IoT-driven efficiency:\\n\\n- **Manufacturing & Industrial:** Factories and industrial plants often have *massive* energy consumption (electric motors, process heat, compressed air systems) and water usage (for cooling or processes). \\n\\nIoT sensors enable **predictive maintenance** (avoiding inefficient operation and downtime) and continuous energy monitoring. According to Deloitte, IoT-based predictive maintenance can cut maintenance costs **up to 25%** and reduce unplanned downtime by **up to 50%** ([Investing in the Future: How Predictive Maintenance Can Drive ROI](https://hexastate.com/investing-in-the-future-how-predictive-maintenance-can-drive-roi/#:~:text=ROI%20hexastate,downtime%20by%20up%20to%2050)) \u2013 improvements that directly protect revenue and reduce waste. \\n\\nThe ROI here comes not only from utility savings but from **increased production uptime**. Many manufacturers see IoT projects pay off within 1\u20132 years just from maintenance savings and energy efficiency (e.g. shutting off idle equipment, optimizing HVAC in warehouses, etc.). \\n\\nIndustrial facilities also often face demand charges; IoT controls can stagger equipment startups and **reduce peak load**, saving on those charges.\\n\\n- **Data Centers & Tech Facilities:** Data centers are energy hogs (powering servers and cooling them). IoT sensors and AI can optimize **cooling systems (HVAC)** \u2013 for example, adjusting setpoints and airflow to match server load or using outside air cooling when conditions allow. \\n\\nEven a 1% improvement in PUE (power usage effectiveness) can translate to tens of thousands of dollars in large data centers. IoT monitoring can also prevent thermal runaway or pinpoint hot spots to avoid overcooling. \\n\\nMany data centers have implemented IoT-driven dynamic cooling and seen **payback in well under 2 years** due to the enormous energy baseline.\\n\\n- **Healthcare (Hospitals):** Hospitals operate 24/7 with intensive HVAC and water demands (sterilization, laundry, etc.). They often have older infrastructure that runs continuously. \\n\\nIoT building management in hospitals can safely reduce HVAC usage in unoccupied zones (or at night in administrative areas), monitor medical refrigeration units, and detect water leaks (important for infection control and cost). \\n\\nGiven that hospitals in high-cost regions can spend $5\u2013$10 million a year on utilities, even a 10% savings is huge. Many hospitals are finding IoT upgrades (sometimes funded through energy performance contracts) that deliver ROI in ~3 years and then free up funds to reinvest in patient care.\\n\\n- **Multifamily Residential:** Apartment complexes and commercial residential buildings benefit from IoT through smart thermostats, leak detectors, and boiler controls. While not \u201cindustrial,\u201d this sector sees strong financial cases for IoT because utility costs often either eat into NOI or are passed to tenants who demand efficiency. \\n\\nAnalytics on energy and water use in multifamily buildings can **increase NOI and property value significantly**, with benchmarking software creating **payback in mere months** for owners ([Impact of Energy and Water Savings on Multifamily Properties | WegoWise](https://www.wegowise.com/resources/financial-impact-of-energy-and-water-savings#:~:text=,property%20to%20an%20entire%20portfolio)). For example, finding and fixing water leaks or insulating a building after IoT data analysis can yield immediate savings that increase an apartment building\u2019s net income (and thus its appraised value) by hundreds of thousands ([Impact of Energy and Water Savings on Multifamily Properties | WegoWise](https://www.wegowise.com/resources/financial-impact-of-energy-and-water-savings#:~:text=,property%20to%20an%20entire%20portfolio)) ([Impact of Energy and Water Savings on Multifamily Properties | WegoWise](https://www.wegowise.com/resources/financial-impact-of-energy-and-water-savings#:~:text=,property%20to%20an%20entire%20portfolio)).\\n\\n- **Agriculture and Irrigation:** In farming, IoT soil moisture sensors and smart irrigation systems drastically reduce water usage (sometimes by 30\u201350%) while improving crop yield. Water is a major cost in agriculture; IoT systems often pay for themselves in **one growing season** by eliminating overwatering and runoff. \\n\\nThis may be outside typical \u201cbusiness office\u201d environments, but for agribusiness CFOs the financial logic is analogous: **spend on IoT to save on water** (and energy for pumping) \u2013 it\u2019s a quick ROI and hedges against drought risks.\\n\\nIn each of these sectors, IoT projects are often **self-funding through savings**. A telling statistic: **92% of enterprises report positive ROI** from IoT implementations, according to a wide-ranging survey ([75F: The World\'s Most Advanced IoT Building Automation](https://www.75f.io/#:~:text=More)). \\n\\nThe industries above are standouts because their pre-IoT utility costs (or maintenance costs) are so high that even modest efficiency gains translate into big financial wins.\\n\\n## ROI Estimates and Payback Periods\\n\\nA data-backed financial analysis is critical for CFO approval. Fortunately, IoT efficiency investments generally have **attractive ROI profiles**. Here are some key points on returns and payback periods, along with examples:\\n\\n- **Typical Payback:** Most IoT energy management projects for buildings see payback within **1 to 3 years**. Lighting retrofits with IoT controls often pay back in ~1\u20132 years (thanks to power savings and utility rebates). \\n\\nHVAC IoT upgrades are often 2\u20133 years unless major equipment replacement is involved. These periods are **well within the lifespan** of the equipment, meaning strong net present value. \\n\\nIn fact, IoT-based solutions often **outperform** traditional capital projects on ROI \u2013 for example, IoT controls (12\u201318 month payback) vs. a chiller replacement (maybe a 7+ year payback).\\n\\n- **Fast Payback Cases (Months, Not Years):** There are numerous instances where IoT projects have **paid for themselves in a matter of months**. For example, an IoT retrofit in a large commercial building that optimized cooling and lighting achieved **15% energy savings (~400,000 kWh/year)** and paid back in **just 5 months** ([Energy Efficient Cities: Building-Level Solutions, Microgrids and IoT](https://www.iotforall.com/energy-efficient-cities-building-solutions-microgrids-iot#:~:text=IoT%20www,that%20building%20cooling%20and)). \\n\\nAnother case: a building analytics software identified operational tweaks that created **an immediate reduction in utility bills, achieving payback in under 6 months** ([Impact of Energy and Water Savings on Multifamily Properties | WegoWise](https://www.wegowise.com/resources/financial-impact-of-energy-and-water-savings#:~:text=,property%20to%20an%20entire%20portfolio)). These \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d scenarios are not universal, but they highlight that *some IoT improvements start contributing to the bottom line almost immediately*. \\n\\nUsually, fast-payback items include things like scheduling controls (which cost little to implement but save a lot by turning things off) and fixing blatant issues (like a mis-programmed HVAC system running 24/7). \\n\\nIt\'s not uncommon for IoT investments to become net-positive within the same fiscal year of implementation for the most wasteful facilities.\\n\\n- **Multi-Year ROI and TCO:** When evaluating multi-year impact, IoT shines even more. A project with a 2-year payback yields a 50% annual ROI; over a 10-year period, that\u2019s a huge cumulative return. \\n\\nIoT systems also often extend equipment life (through reduced run-time and predictive maintenance), which avoids capital expenditures \u2013 those avoided costs effectively improve the ROI when viewed holistically. For instance, if smart monitoring prevents a $50k catastrophic failure of a boiler that would have happened in year 3, that \u201csaving\u201d should be included. \\n\\nMany CFOs therefore consider not just direct utility savings but also **risk mitigation ROI** (avoided damage, downtime, compliance fines, etc.) which IoT provides by giving early warning of issues.\\n\\n- **ROI in Financial Terms:** CFOs may translate savings into familiar metrics like **increase in EBITDA or asset value**. Energy savings drop straight to the bottom line. \\n\\nFor a property owner, reducing operating costs by $1 can increase asset value by $10\u2013$20 (using cap rates of 5\u201310%). We saw an example where **$69,700 in annual energy/water savings raised a multifamily property\u2019s value by $610k\u2013$1.16M** ([Impact of Energy and Water Savings on Multifamily Properties | WegoWise](https://www.wegowise.com/resources/financial-impact-of-energy-and-water-savings#:~:text=,property%20to%20an%20entire%20portfolio)). \\n\\nSimilar logic applies to commercial buildings \u2013 an office building that saves $100k/yr in utilities could be worth $1\u20132 million more. Thus, IoT isn\u2019t just cutting this year\u2019s expenses, it\u2019s **building long-term enterprise value**. \\n\\nThe ROI can be communicated in those terms for clarity \u2013 e.g., \u201cThis IoT upgrade has a 50% IRR and increases our building\u2019s appraised value by $X million.\u201d\\n\\n- **Real-world Benchmarks:** \\n  - *Hotels:* 15\u201320% energy savings, **ROI ~50\u2013100%** (payback 1\u20132 years) ([](http://verdant.copeland.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Increasing-Profitability-with-IoT-Technology.pdf#:~:text=EI,Verdant%20Energy%20Management%20Thermostats%20Lightning)). \\n  - *Offices:* 10\u201330% savings, ROI often **30\u201380%** (payback ~1.5\u20133 years). Many see positive cash flow from year 1 due to financing or phased roll-outs.\\n  - *Retail:* 10\u201320% savings, ROI ~20\u201360% (payback ~2\u20134 years, faster for larger stores). The variance depends on store size and hours \u2013 24-hour big boxes save more absolute energy and thus have faster ROI.\\n  - *Industrial:* ROI can be extremely high when preventing costly downtime \u2013 often justified on reliability alone, with energy savings as a bonus (difficult to generalize a number, but many have seen multi-hundred-percent ROI just from avoiding one big failure).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nFrom the above analysis, it\u2019s clear that **IoT-driven efficiency is a financially savvy move** for businesses in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco, and beyond. High utility rates in many of these cities magnify the value of saving each kilowatt-hour or gallon. \\n\\nIoT implementations can often be justified purely on an actuarial cost-savings basis: by reducing waste (often ~15\u201330%), they slash recurring expenses and pay back rapidly. \\n\\nCrucially, we identified that even mid-sized facilities (tens of thousands of square feet, or utility bills in the mid five-figures) reach the threshold where IoT is compelling. \\n\\nNo longer is IoT only for marquee skyscrapers or giant factories \u2013 **it\u2019s now an essential tool for cost control and sustainability in everyday businesses.** Retail stores can curtail one of their largest operating costs, hotels can protect their thin margins from energy volatility, and offices can turn facility management into a source of savings. \\n\\nOther industries like manufacturing, data centers, and healthcare are similarly ripe for IoT optimizations that bolster the bottom line.\\n\\nFor CFOs and financial decision-makers, the message is: **investing in IoT solutions is not an experimental tech spree, but a prudent financial strategy**. The data shows that these investments yield tangible returns \u2013 often boosting annual profits after a short payback period and continuing to generate savings year after year. \\n\\nIn many cases, IoT upgrades can be structured so that savings exceed costs from day one (via smart financing or phased implementation), making the decision even easier.\\n\\nIn sum, implementing IoT for utility management is a **cost-saving measure with proven ROI**, vital for business sustainability and competitiveness. Companies that embrace it will not only reduce expenses and improve their efficiency metrics; they\u2019ll also enhance asset values and resilience against future utility cost increases. \\n\\nAs illustrated with the rates and examples for NYC, LA, Chicago, Houston, and SF, the numbers speak clearly: **IoT is a smart investment that pays for itself \u2013 often quicker than expected \u2013 and continues paying dividends in operational savings.** \\n\\n## Utility Cost Landscape in Major Cities\\n\\nUtility rates vary widely by city and region. To compare costs, we\u2019ve converted water and sewer rates to a common unit (CCF, or hundred cubic feet; *1 CCF \u2248 748 gallons*). Electricity is given in cents per kilowatt-hour (\xa2/kWh) and natural gas in dollars per therm (1 therm \u2248 100 cubic feet of gas). Below are **official utility rates** in each city:\\n\\n### New York City (NYC)\\n\\n**Water:** $4.49 per CCF; **Sewer:** $7.14 per CCF (159% of water rate) Combined, [NYC businesses pay about **$11.63 per CCF**](https://www.nyc.gov/site/nycwaterboard/rates/rates-regulations.page#:~:text=2025%207%2F1%2F24,33) of water consumed. \\n\\n**Electricity:** ~17.7\xa2/kWh on average for commercial customers ([Electric Power Monthly - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a#:~:text=New%20York%2024,51)). \\n\\n**Natural Gas:** Approximately $1.00\u2013$1.20 per therm (varies seasonally). New York\u2019s water/sewer costs are relatively high (FY2025 rates rise to $4.87 + $7.74 = **$12.61/CCF** ([Rates & Regulations - Water Board](https://www.nyc.gov/site/nycwaterboard/rates/rates-regulations.page#:~:text=2025%207%2F1%2F24,33))), making water efficiency critical.\\n\\n### Los Angeles (LA)\\n\\n**Water:** ~$9.39 per CCF ([City of LA, commercial Tier-1 rate mid-2024](https://www.ladwp.com/account/customer-service/water-rates/schedule-c-commercial-industrial-governmental)).

This equals **$3.51 per CCF** for sewer, or about **$7.02 per CCF combined**.  Chicago\u2019s water costs per volume are lower than coastal cities. \\n\\n**Electricity:** ~11.5\xa2/kWh [on average for commercial users in Illinois](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a#:~:text=New%20York%2024,51). \\n\\n**Natural Gas:** ~$0.95\u2013$1.00 per therm ([Peoples Gas in Chicago has a 2024 cap at ~$0.97/therm](https://www.peoplesgas.com/4a5cbb/contentassets/76b6b8638ec743a18f041648c4c29bd1/july-2024-commercial-rates.pdf#:~:text=,%E2%80%A2%20Swing)).\\n\\n### Houston \\n\\n**Water:** tiered by usage; in 2022 commercial rates were ~$5.55 per 1,000 gallons, rising to over $7.00 per 1,000 gallons by 2024 ([](https://www.houstontx.gov/citysec/HPW/ratestable.pdf#:~:text=Industrial%20All%20Usage%205,39)) (roughly **$5.3 per CCF**). \\n\\n**Sewer:** similarly rising into the ~$9+ per 1,000 gal range by 2024 ([](https://www.houstontx.gov/citysec/HPW/ratestable.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L294%20Commercial%20All,60)) (~**$6.9 per CCF**). Combined, Houston\u2019s water/sewer runs around **$12\u2013$13 per CCF** for high-volume users. \\n\\n**Electricity:** ~8.7\xa2/kWh average for Texas commercial customers ([energy costs are low due to deregulated markets](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a#:~:text=Texas%2015,71)). \\n\\n**Natural Gas:** ~$0.50\u2013$0.60 per therm (Texas enjoys low gas prices). *Houston\u2019s relatively cheap electricity makes HVAC efficiency more about peak demand management than unit cost, while water is a growing expense.* \\n\\n### San Francisco (SF)\\n\\n**Water:** SFPUC charges uniform rates for businesses; [wholesale cost to the city is ~$5.21/CCF](https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/files/assets/public/v/1/utilities/rates-schedules-for-utilities/prop-218-notice-fy25-final.pdf#:~:text=It%20is%20anticipated%20that%20beginning,to), with retail rates higher after distribution costs (on the order of ~$7\u2013$8+ per CCF for end-users). \\n\\n**Sewer:** San Francisco\u2019s combined sewer/stormwater system leads to high wastewater fees that depend on discharge volume and strength. For typical commercial waste strength, sewer rates per CCF can **exceed water rates** (often making total water + sewer > **$15 per CCF**). \\n\\n**Electricity:** ~18\xa2/kWh for commercial users ([California average](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.php?t=epmt_5_6_a#:~:text=match%20at%20L384%20California%2032,68)) note SF\u2019s electricity is delivered by PG&E or CleanPowerSF at similar averages. \\n\\n**Natural Gas:** ~$1.10\u2013$1.20 per therm (PG&E gas rates). *San Francisco has some of the highest combined water-sewer costs, so water efficiency and leak detection IoT can yield particularly large savings.*"},{"id":"/2025/02/06/LoRaWAN_for_senior_tracking","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/02/06/LoRaWAN_for_senior_tracking","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-06-LoRaWAN_for_senior_tracking.md","title":"LoRaWAN In Elder Care","description":"Can you use LoRaWAN for emergencies?

Instead of inventing a new modulation from scratch, Cycleo applied CSS (a technique long used in sonar and radar) to IoT communications \u2013 essentially repurposing chirp signals for data transmission\u200b. The breakthrough proved that kilometer-range wireless links could be achieved with very low power, ideal for battery-operated IoT sensors.\\n\\nSeeing the potential, Semtech acquired Cycleo in 2012, gaining the LoRa IP and the small team of inventors\u200b. Over the next few years, Semtech refined the technology into silicon \u2013 releasing chipsets like the [SX1272](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-connect/sx1272)/1276 transceivers for end devices and the multi-channel [SX1301](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-core/sx1301) for gateways\u200b. With hardware in place, attention turned to creating a standardized networking protocol on top of LoRa. \\n\\nIn 2015, industry leaders including Semtech, Actility, and IBM formed the LoRa Alliance, which published the first LoRaWAN specification. LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) defines the MAC-layer protocol and architecture for LoRa networks, enabling interoperability across vendors. The first LoRaWAN spec (v1.0) emerged around 2015, and the Alliance began promoting it as an open standard for Low Power WAN.\\n\\n### Early Adoption (2015\u20132017)\\n\\nLoRaWAN quickly gained traction, especially in Europe. By 2016, multiple telecom operators had launched LoRaWAN networks as a complement or alternative to cellular IoT. For example, Orange and Bouygues Telecom in France each deployed nationwide LoRaWAN coverage by 2016, [seeing LoRa as a ready solution for IoT](https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2015/09/taking-aim-at-sigfox-orange-announces-rollout-for-a-lora-based-iot-network-in-2016/#:~:text=Taking%20aim%20at%20SIGFOX%2C%20Orange,the%20first%20quarter%20of%202016) before NB-IoT was widely available\u200b. \\n\\nKPN in the Netherlands likewise [rolled out a nationwide LoRaWAN network by mid-2016](https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/sk-telecom-kpn-deploy-nationwide-lorawan-iot-networks/2016/07/), one of the first in the world\u200b. In South Korea, [SK Telecom partnered with Samsung](https://www.samsung.com/global/business/networks/insights/press-release/samsung-electronics-to-jointly-build-skt-world-first-nationwide-lorawan-network-dedicated-to-iot/#:~:text=Samsung%20Electronics%20to%20jointly%20build,2016) to deploy a country-wide LoRaWAN network in 2016, offering IoT coverage spanning 99% of the population. \\n\\nThese early networks targeted applications like smart city sensors and asset tracking. Simultaneously, the open community model took off: [The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/), launched in 2015 in Amsterdam, rallied volunteers to set up LoRaWAN gateways and provide free community coverage in hundreds of cities globally, demonstrating grassroots adoption.\\n\\n### Growth and Maturity (2018\u20132021) \\n\\nBy 2018, LoRaWAN had achieved significant global footprint. The LoRa Alliance reported over [100 network operators in 100+ countries by 2018](https://lora-alliance.org/lora-alliance-press-release/lora-alliance-registra-una-crescita-del-66-delle-reti-pubbliche-lorawan-negli-ultimi-3-anni/)\u200b. This included not just telecom-led public networks, but also private enterprise networks and community deployments. \\n\\nOver these years, the LoRaWAN specification evolved (versions 1.1, 1.0.3 etc.) to add features like better security, roaming between networks, and firmware updates over-the-air. The ecosystem expanded with more device makers and solution providers joining the Alliance. Cumulative device deployments climbed into the tens of millions, driven by use cases in smart utilities, agriculture, and logistics. By 2020, Semtech estimated over 100 million devices were running on LoRa/LoRaWAN globally. \\n\\nA major milestone in 2021 was **LoRaWAN\u2019s recognition by the ITU-T as an official international standard for LPWAN**, [cementing its status alongside cellular standards](https://www.melita.io/articles-news/lora-alliance-publishes-annual-report-global-expansion-of-the-lorawan-market-in-2022/#:~:text=The%20report%20reveals%20that%20LoRaWAN,and%20most%20diverse%20IoT%20ecosystem)\u200b. This ITU approval (achieved in late 2021) underscored LoRaWAN\u2019s maturity and interoperability as an open protocol.\\n\\n### Recent Developments (2022\u20132025) \\n\\nIn the last few years, LoRaWAN adoption has accelerated and diversified. As of the end of 2022, [industry analysts estimated over 200 million LoRaWAN devices were active worldwide](https://transformainsights.com/low-power-wide-area-networks#:~:text=Insights%20transformainsights,deployment%2C%20the%20focus%20of)\u200b. The LoRa Alliance\u2019s 2022 report highlighted that LoRaWAN is no longer \u201cnew\u201d but a widely adopted IoT technology, with deployments in 160+ countries and a rapidly growing ecosystem\u200b. By 2023, the number of LoRaWAN network operators had nearly doubled to ~200 (from 100 in 2018), providing coverage [\u201cin nearly every country in the world\u201d](https://lora-alliance.org/lora-alliance-press-release/lora-alliance-registra-una-crescita-del-66-delle-reti-pubbliche-lorawan-negli-ultimi-3-anni/)\u200b. \\n\\nAnalyst projections show LoRa/LoRaWAN connections continuing a steep rise: [around 500 million connections in 2024, expected to reach 1.3 billion by 2030](https://www.rcrwireless.com/20240619/internet-of-things/nb-iot-and-lorawan-crowned-the-kings-of-long-range-iot-to-double-connections-to-3-5bn-in-five-years#:~:text=judging%20by%20a%20cursory%20look,3%20million)\u200b. This growth is now driven not just by traditional public networks, but also by community and hybrid models. A notable phenomenon has been the Helium network, a community-built LoRaWAN network where individuals deploy hotspots. By 2022, Helium had over 800,000 LoRaWAN gateways worldwide contributing coverage\u200b, although that has stabilized to around [300,000 gateways today](https://world.helium.com/en/iot/hotspots) \u2013 a scale rivaling telecom operators. Another trend is LoRaWAN via satellite: since 2020, multiple operators (e.g. [Lacuna Space](https://lacuna-space.com/), [EchoStar](https://echostarmobile.com/lora-satellite-iot-devices/), [Eutelsat](https://www.eutelsat.com/en/blog/iot-connectivity-for-businesses.html) have launched LoRaWAN-capable satellites, aiming for global IoT coverage for remote areas\u200b. LoRaWAN protocol extensions now support satellite links and have opened use cases in maritime and wilderness monitoring.\\n\\nTechnologically, LoRaWAN has continued to improve. Newer device classes and features ([Class B for scheduled receive slots, Class C for near-continuous listening](https://www.semtech.com/uploads/technology/LoRa/lorawan-device-classes.pdf)) were implemented to support applications needing downlink or lower latency. Recent specifications have introduced relay nodes and network roaming to increase coverage and flexibility. \\n\\nThe focus has also turned to network scalability and management as deployments grew \u2013 demonstrated by initiatives like [LoRaWAN Network Roaming](https://lora-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/actility.pdf) across providers and the development of peering platforms (e.g. [Packet Broker](https://packetbroker.net/getting-started/what-is-packet-broker/)) to interconnect public and private LoRaWAN networks. \\n\\nAll these advancements show LoRaWAN\u2019s evolution from a novel idea to a mature, global IoT standard with a decade of development. It now stands alongside cellular IoT options, offering a proven low-power, long-range connectivity solution with a robust ecosystem.\\n\\n## Key Players in the LoRaWAN Ecosystem\\n\\n**Semtech Corporation** \u2013 Semtech is the semiconductor company that owns and licenses LoRa technology. It acquired French startup Cycleo (the inventor of LoRa\u2019s radio modulation) in 2012 to [commercialize LoRa chips\u200b](https://blog.semtech.com/a-brief-history-of-lora-three-inventors-share-their-personal-story-at-the-things-conference#:~:text=Convinced%20about%20the%20long%20range,time%2C%20the%20creation%20of%20the). Semtech produces the LoRa transceiver chips (e.g. SX1272/76) used in IoT devices and gateway chipsets (e.g. SX1301) that form the hardware backbone of LoRaWAN networks\u200b. Semtech has been the key driver behind LoRa\u2019s development and works closely with the [LoRa Alliance](https://www.lora-alliance.org/).\\n\\n**The Things Industries (TTI)** \u2013 [The Things Industries](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/) is the company behind The Things Network, a global open LoRaWAN community. Led by founders like Wienke Giezeman, TTI provides a LoRaWAN network server and infrastructure that power both community-driven and commercial deployments.

TTI is a leading provider of LoRaWAN solutions for enterprises, and a prominent member of the LoRa Alliance\u200b.\\n\\n**Actility** \u2013 [Actility](https://www.actility.com/) (founded by Olivier Hersent in 2010) is a French company and a pioneer in LPWAN connectivity platforms. Actility\u2019s ThingPark platform is widely used for [industrial-grade LoRaWAN network management\u200b](https://www.semtech.com/company/press/leading-iot-industry-players-bring-implementation-of-relay-utilizing-lorawan-to-market#:~:text=Actility%20is%20the%20world%20leader,Actility%20provides%20its). Many telecom operators launching LoRaWAN networks have partnered with Actility for core network servers. Actility is considered a world leader in LoRaWAN network solutions, enabling nationwide deployments and IoT services for smart cities, utilities, and industry\u200b.\\n\\n**Helium** \u2013 [Helium](https://www.helium.com/) is a blockchain-based network for the Internet of Things (IoT). It uses a crowdsourced network of LoRaWAN gateways to provide coverage for the internet of things. The Helium blockchain is used to reward gateways for contributing to the network.\\n\\nOther Major Companies \u2013 The LoRaWAN ecosystem includes many players across hardware, network operations, and cloud services. Key contributors in the LoRa Alliance include [device manufacturers, network operators, and cloud giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa#:~:text=Key%20contributing%20members%20of%20the,36)\u200b. Notable examples are [Kerlink](https://www.kerlink.com/) (LoRaWAN gateway manufacturer), [TEKTELIC](https://tektelic.com/products/gateways/) and [MikroTik](https://mikrotik.com/products/group/iot-products) (hardware providers), [Netmore](https://www.rcrwireless.com/20240207/internet-of-things/netmore-buys-senet-to-create-trans-atlantic-lorawan-operator) which recently acquired Senet (a former LoRaWAN operator in the US), [Everynet](https://everynet.com/) (operates LoRaWAN networks internationally), and [MachineQ](https://www.machineq.com/) (Comcast) \u2013 Comcast\u2019s enterprise IoT arm offering LoRaWAN in the US\u200b. \\n\\nCloud and tech companies like Amazon Web Services ([AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/lorawan/)) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/) are also involved, providing IoT services that integrate LoRaWAN connectivity\u200b. Even traditional telcos and tech firms such as Cisco were part of the ecosystem (Cisco provided LoRaWAN infrastructure gear, though it [announced its exit](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/wireless-gateway-lorawan/lorawan-eol.html) from this market in late 2024)\u200b.\\n\\n## Notable Individuals and Thought Leaders\\n\\nThe LoRaWAN industry was [kickstarted by inventors Nicolas Sornin and Olivier Seller](https://blog.semtech.com/a-brief-history-of-lora-three-inventors-share-their-personal-story-at-the-things-conference#:~:text=The%20story%20of%20LoRa%20began,the%20technology%20for%20sending%20data.), who in 2009 first developed the long-range, chirp spread spectrum radio technology that became LoRa\u200b. They co-founded Cycleo with Fran\xe7ois Sforza to target utility metering, which led to Semtech\u2019s acquisition in 2012\u200b. [Nicolas Sornin](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/article/nicolas-sornin-tells-about-the-future-of-lorawan) is often credited as the inventor of LoRa/LoRaWAN and continues to influence LoRaWAN\u2019s evolution as an executive at Semtech. \\n\\nOn the ecosystem side, [Wienke Giezeman](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/u/wienkegiezeman) and [Johan Stokking](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/u/johan) (The Things Network founders) are notable for mobilizing the global LoRaWAN community. \\n\\n[Olivier Hersent](https://www.actility.com/management-team/) (Actility\u2019s CEO) is a recognized expert who helped shape LoRaWAN\u2019s early technical architecture. In the LoRa Alliance,former CEO [Donna Moore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/donnamoore4/) has been instrumental in driving global standardization and adoption while current CEO [Alper Yegin](https://lora-alliance.org/author/alper-yeginlora-alliance-com/), appointed in October of 2024, has a track record indicating a strategic, forward-looking approach to ecosystem development.\\n\\n[Thomas Telkamp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomastelkamp/), CTO and co-foudner at Lacuna Space brought LoRaWAN into space, which was important because prior to this, if there wasn\'t a physical gateway on the ground, you weren\'t getting LoRaWAN coverage.\\n\\nOther thought leaders include industry engineers like [Olivier Seller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivier-seller-527909/?originalSubdomain=fr) (Semtech) and ecosystem advocates such as [Marc P\xe9gulu](https://www.techtarget.com/contributor/Marc-Pegulu) (Semtech\u2019s IoT VP) and [Amir Haleem](https://x.com/amirhaleem), co-founder of [Helium](https://www.helium.com/), which used crowdsourcing to build the largest LoRaWAN network in the world. \\n\\n[Dave Kjendal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dkjendal/), the former CTO at Senet and LoRa Alliance Technical Director and [Dave Tholl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-tholl-a31252a/?originalSubdomain=ca) at Tektelic have also contributed mightily to the LoRaWAN ecosystem.\\n\\nThese individuals, among others, have guided LoRaWAN from a niche technology to a global IoT standard.\\n\\n## LoRaWAN vs. Other LPWAN Technologies\\n\\nLoRaWAN is one of several Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies addressing IoT connectivity. \\nThe LPWAN field also includes cellular standards like NB-IoT and LTE-M, and proprietary systems like Sigfox, among others. Below is a brief comparison for context:\\n\\n**LoRaWAN (LoRa Wide Area Network):** An open LPWAN protocol operating in unlicensed ISM bands (e.g. 868 MHz in Europe, 915 MHz in US). LoRaWAN\u2019s key advantages are its long range (15+ km in rural areas), very low power consumption, and an ecosystem not tied to any single operator \u2013 anyone can set up a LoRaWAN network. As a result, LoRaWAN supports private networks (enterprise or community) as well as public operator networks. \\n\\nGlobally, LoRa/LoRaWAN connections were estimated around 500 million in 2024, headed toward 1.3 billion by 2030\u200b. LoRaWAN leads the LPWAN market in Europe and North America and is the top choice for private IoT deployments worldwide\u200b. Its alliance-driven model means a multi-vendor ecosystem of devices, gateways, and software, giving users choice and often lower cost. The trade-off is that LoRaWAN operates in unlicensed spectrum, which has power and duty-cycle limits and potential interference (mitigated by adaptive data rates and robust modulation).\\n\\n**NB-IoT ([Narrowband IoT](https://www.gsma.com/solutions-and-impact/technologies/internet-of-things/narrow-band-internet-of-things-nb-iot/)):** A LPWAN radio standard defined by 3GPP, operating in licensed cellular spectrum. NB-IoT is deployed by mobile carriers on their infrastructure. It offers similar low-data, long-battery capabilities as LoRaWAN, but with telco control. [NB-IoT has seen massive adoption in China](https://www.lightreading.com/iot/china-crosses-100m-nb-iot-connections-but-still-short-of-target) \u2013 about 90% of NB-IoT connections are in China\u200b thanks to strong government and operator backing. Globally, NB-IoT leads in total connections; as of 2024 NB-IoT had ~900 million connections (mostly in Asia), projected to reach ~1.9 billion by 2030\u200b. LoRaWAN, by contrast, [dominates in most regions outside China](https://www.iot-now.com/2024/06/20/145050-nb-iot-and-lora-dominate-lpwan-market/)\u200b. \\n\\nNB-IoT\u2019s reliance on carriers means it\u2019s used primarily for operator-driven public networks (e.g. [nationwide utility metering by telcos](https://stl.tech/blog/how-do-telcos-contribute-to-utilities-that-utilize-iot-technology/)). It generally offers slightly higher data rates than LoRaWAN and better integration with cellular networks, at the cost of higher infrastructure complexity and usually less flexibility for private deployments.\\n\\n**Sigfox:** [Sigfox](https://www.sigfox.com/) is a proprietary LPWAN technology (originating from a French startup of the same name) that also uses unlicensed sub-GHz spectrum but with a very narrow-band modulation. Sigfox networks are characterized by ultra-narrowband signals and a star topology with Sigfox-owned base stations. In the 2010s, Sigfox built out its own global network in dozens of countries. \\n\\nUnlike LoRaWAN\u2019s open multi-operator approach, Sigfox was a single-network, vertically integrated solution. Sigfox achieved some adoption (notably in France, Spain, and parts of Latin America) for simple sensors and tracking devices, but it faced challenges scaling. By end of 2023, [the installed base of Sigfox devices was only about 12.5 million](https://www.rcrwireless.com/20240619/internet-of-things/nb-iot-and-lorawan-crowned-the-kings-of-long-range-iot-to-double-connections-to-3-5bn-in-five-years)\u200b \u2013 far lower than LoRaWAN or NB-IoT. The Sigfox company filed for bankruptcy in 2022 and was acquired by Unabiz, which is now attempting to revive and open up the ecosystem\u200b. Sigfox\u2019s technical limits (very low message counts per day, no mesh or relay capabilities) and the business model of a single global operator hampered its growth relative to LoRaWAN\u2019s flexible approach.\\n\\n**LTE-M (Cat-M1):** [LTE-M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE-M) is a cellular IoT standard (also by 3GPP) that can be seen as the \u201ctwin\u201d of NB-IoT, offering higher bandwidth and mobility (supporting device handover between cell towers) at the cost of higher power usage. It operates in licensed bands on LTE networks. LTE-M is often used for applications needing more data or voice (e.g. wearables or vehicle telematics), complementing NB-IoT. In LPWAN contexts, LTE-M has a smaller share: around 100+ million connections in 2024, forecast to reach ~400 million by 2030\u200b. \\n\\nLTE-M is popular in North America (operators like AT&T, Verizon deployed LTE-M nationwide) and developed Asia (e.g. Japan) for IoT use cases that require the cellular network\u2019s QoS and roaming. However, for the very low-power, low-cost sensor scenarios, LTE-M is less efficient than LoRaWAN or NB-IoT.\\n\\nOther LPWANs: There are other niche or emerging LPWAN technologies. **Wi-SUN** (Wireless Smart Utility Network) is a mesh networking standard often used by utilities (especially in smart electricity metering) \u2013 it isn\u2019t strictly long-range star network like LoRaWAN, but serves a similar market. **MIoTy** is a newer LPWAN protocol based on telegram-splitting (TS-UNB) technology, targeting industrial IoT with high interference tolerance. These technologies are still in early stages; collectively their deployments were around 20 million devices in 2024\u200b, expected to grow to 100+ million by 2030. They target specific niches (Wi-SUN in utility grids, MIoTy in factory sensor networks, etc.), often inspired by the success of LoRaWAN\u2019s open ecosystem model.\\n\\nIn summary, [NB-IoT and LoRaWAN are the two dominant LPWAN technologies globally](https://www.rcrwireless.com/20240619/internet-of-things/nb-iot-and-lorawan-crowned-the-kings-of-long-range-iot-to-double-connections-to-3-5bn-in-five-years#:~:text=NB,3%20million), accounting for about 86% of LPWA connections today. NB-IoT holds the lead in absolute connections due to China\u2019s massive deployments, but LoRaWAN is the leader in most other regions and in private IoT networks\u200b. Sigfox, once a competitor, now lags far behind in scale\u200b. \\n\\nLoRaWAN\u2019s openness, flexibility, and multi-vendor support have made it a preferred choice for many IoT projects, while NB-IoT is preferred when a licensed-band, operator-managed solution is required (especially by government mandate or where existing cellular infrastructure is leveraged). The two aren\u2019t mutually exclusive \u2013 some IoT solutions use LoRaWAN for certain tasks and NB-IoT or LTE-M for others, and hybrid deployments are evolving. But broadly, the LPWAN landscape has settled into a duopoly of LoRaWAN and NB-IoT coexisting, with LoRaWAN excelling in unlicensed, collaborative deployments and NB-IoT in carrier-centric models\u200b\\n\\n\\n\\n# Global LPWAN Technology Analysis 2024\\n\\n| Technology | Spectrum | Standard & Ecosystem | Estimated Devices (2024) | Notable Regions and Uses |\\n|------------|----------|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|\\n| LoRaWAN | Unlicensed ISM (e.g. 868/915 MHz) | Open standard via LoRa Alliance; multi-vendor ecosystem (Semtech chips) | ~500 million RCRWIRELESS.COM (projected to 1.3B by 2030) | Global (leader outside China) RCRWIRELESS.COM; used in smart cities, utilities, agriculture, logistics, private IoT networks. |\\n| NB-IoT | Licensed Cellular (e.g. LTE bands) | 3GPP standard (cellular operators) | ~900 million RCRWIRELESS.COM (projected ~1.9B by 2030) | Dominant in China (90% of connections) RCRWIRELESS.COM; growing in Europe, ME.

Europe was an early adopter and remains a stronghold of LoRaWAN deployment. By 2020, [Europe accounted for about 36.4%](https://www.industryarc.com/Report/19424/lora-and-lorawan-devices-market.html) of the global LoRa/LoRaWAN devices market \u2013 the largest share at the time\u200b. European countries embraced LoRaWAN early for national networks and city projects. \\n\\n**France** not only saw its major telcos deploy LoRaWAN nationwide, but also has millions of devices in operation. France alone has [over 1.5 million LoRaWAN devices deployed](https://resources.lora-alliance.org/home/lorawan-deployments-achieve-market-leadership-deliver-strong-roi-for-iot-across-wide-spectrum-of-industries-across-france-and-spain) as of 2022\u200b, including applications like smart water meters and environmental sensors. The Spanish government [plans to deploy 13.5 million smart water meters by 2025](https://lora-alliance.org/category/lora-alliance-press-release/page/5/) (a \u20ac1.35\u202fbillion project), many of which will use LoRaWAN for connectivity\u200b \u2013 a testament to the country\u2019s investment in this tech for utilities. **Spain** is a leading market in Europe, with about 500,000 LoRaWAN devices active (and 200k more being added) as of 2022\u200b. Countries like the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and Germany also host nationwide or wide-scale LoRaWAN networks, often led by telecom operators or regional utility collaborations.\\n\\n**North America** has become a major growth region for LoRaWAN in recent years. The United States in particular has seen wide adoption of private LoRaWAN networks in enterprise and industrial contexts, as well as community deployments. [Market reports](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/09/10/2943901/0/en/LoRa-and-LoRaWAN-IoT-Market-Is-Expected-To-Reach-a-Revenue-Of-USD-183-9-Bn-By-2033-At-36-5-CAGR-Dimension-Market-Research.html#:~:text=Regional%20Analysis-,North%20America%20is%20projected%20to%20dominate%20the%20global%20LoRa%20and,supporting%20large%2Dscale%20IoT%20deployments.) indicate North America is now the leading region by LoRaWAN market revenue, with about 40.1% of global LoRa/LoRaWAN market share in 2024\u200b. \\n\\nThis leadership is driven by large-scale deployments in sectors like smart agriculture (e.g. connected irrigation in California), logistics (asset tracking in supply chains), and smart buildings. Several dedicated LoRaWAN network operators have emerged in the US, such as Senet (covering many regions with public LoRaWAN service) and MachineQ (Comcast) providing LoRaWAN for enterprise campuses. Moreover, the **Helium** community network \u2013 with over 800k crowd-funded hotspots across North America and beyond \u2013 has effectively blanketed many urban areas with LoRaWAN coverage\u200b. \\n\\nThis combination of commercial and community initiatives has attracted significant investment into LoRaWAN-based solutions in the U.S. and Canada. (In Canada, cities like Calgary and companies in mining/oil industries are using LoRaWAN for remote monitoring). North America\u2019s momentum is further boosted by cloud integration; e.g., Amazon\u2019s [AWS IoT Core supports LoRaWAN devices](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/lorawan/), making it easier for businesses to adopt the technology.\\n\\n**Asia-Pacific** presents a mixed landscape due to the prominence of NB-IoT in some countries. \\n\\n**China**, by policy, focused on NB-IoT (with tens of millions of NB-IoT smart meters deployed), so LoRaWAN\u2019s public footprint in China is relatively small. However, LoRa is used in China in private industrial networks and by some regional carriers for specific verticals. Outside China, LoRaWAN has seen strong uptake in Asia. \\n\\n**South Korea** was one of the first APAC countries to invest heavily \u2013 SK Telecom\u2019s nationwide LoRaWAN network (launched 2016) was used for services from metering to manhole monitoring\u200b. \\n\\n**India** has a [large LoRaWAN network rolled out](https://www.tatacommunications.com/press-release/hpe-work-tata-communications-build-worlds-largest-iot-network-india-enhance-resource-utilization/) by Tata Communications covering dozens of cities, supporting use cases like smart street lighting, agriculture, and asset tracking. In **Japan**, telecom operators and big tech firms (e.g. SoftBank, NEC) have run LoRaWAN trials and deployments for smart city systems. **Australia** and **New Zealand** have active LoRaWAN communities and regional networks (often targeting agriculture in remote areas). Generally, Asia-Pacific is seen as the fastest-growing LoRaWAN market, as IoT adoption surges across Southeast Asia and India\u200b. \\n\\nThe absence of ubiquitous NB-IoT in some emerging economies gives LoRaWAN an opportunity to be the connectivity of choice for IoT projects, which is reflected in increasing investments there.\\n\\n### Other Regions: \\n\\nIn **Latin America**, LoRaWAN has gained traction in countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina for smart agriculture and city applications. For example, Brazil has LoRaWAN networks used in agri-tech (connecting farm sensors over long ranges). \\n\\n**Mexico City** has pilot projects for air quality monitoring on LoRaWAN. Many LATAM deployments have been spearheaded by local telcos in partnership with LoRaWAN solution providers. \\n\\nIn the Middle East and Africa, IoT adoption is still emerging, but LoRaWAN is present in several countries. **South Africa** has seen LoRaWAN used in wildlife conservation and utility metering pilots. \\n\\nThe United Arab Emirates and [Saudi Arabia have smart city initiatives](https://saudiex.com.sa/what-is-lorawan/) where LoRaWAN is evaluated for connecting municipal sensors. One advantage in developing regions is LoRaWAN\u2019s low cost and flexibility (no need for licensed spectrum), making it attractive for NGOs and city authorities to deploy networks for specific needs (like disaster warning sensors, agricultural soil monitoring, etc.). The LoRa Alliance notes that as of 2020, LoRaWAN networks (public or private) are active in over 160 countries worldwide, indicating a truly global spread.\\n\\nTo support this growth, over 160 major mobile network operators (MNOs) have deployed LoRaWAN networks or services globally\u200b. This is a remarkable number, showing that many of the same telecom companies that run cellular networks also invest in LoRaWAN as part of their IoT portfolio. Examples include Orange, SK Telecom, KPN, Swisscom, Deutsche Telekom (via subsidiary), Comcast, Telstra, and Tata Communications, among many others. This broad backing by operators and enterprises ensures continuing investment into LoRaWAN infrastructure in virtually every region.\\n\\n(For a snapshot of key LoRaWAN markets, see Table 2.)\\n\\n## Table 2: Selected LoRaWAN Adoption Highlights by Country/Region\\n\\n| Country/Region | LoRaWAN Adoption Highlights |\\n|---------------|----------------------------|\\n| France | Two nationwide networks (Orange & Bouygues) since 2016; >1.5 million devices on LoRaWAN to date MOKOLORA.COM. Major projects in utilities (e.g. plan for 13.5M smart water meters by 2025) MOKOLORA.COM and smart cities. Paris and other cities use LoRaWAN for street lighting, parking sensors, and environmental monitoring. |\\n| United States | Mix of public and private deployments; no single nationwide network, but regional coverage by operators like Senet and community Helium network (~800k gateways) BLOG.LORA-ALLIANCE.ORG. Used in industrial IoT (oil & gas, manufacturing), agriculture (crop monitoring in California), and logistics (asset tracking by logistics firms). Comcast\'s MachineQ and Everynet provide LoRaWAN in many metro areas. Strong enterprise uptake due to easy private network setup. |\\n| Netherlands | Early adopter \u2013 KPN launched one of the first national LoRaWAN networks in 2016 SDXCENTRAL.COM. Also home to The Things Network, which started in Amsterdam and spread community LoRaWAN across Europe. LoRaWAN used in smart agriculture (e.g. soil sensors in fields) and flood control (dike monitoring sensors) by Dutch water authorities. |\\n| India | Tata Communications deployed LoRaWAN across ~38 cities by 2017, creating one of the largest LoRa networks in Asia. Focus on smart city use cases: connected streetlights, waste management, and soil moisture sensors for farmers. Indian startups and system integrators have embraced LoRaWAN for its cost-effectiveness in rural IoT projects. |\\n| South Korea | SK Telecom completed a nationwide LoRaWAN network in 2016 SAMSUNG.COM, parallel to its LTE-M rollout. LoRaWAN is used for city services in Seoul and other areas: e.g. monitoring public infrastructure (manholes, streetlights) and providing connectivity for thousands of gas and water meters. South Korea\'s case proved the feasibility of large-scale LoRaWAN by a mobile operator. |\\n| Spain | Rapid growth in LoRaWAN deployments; ~500,000 devices live on LoRaWAN (2022) MOKOLORA.COM, with more being added for smart utility and tracking projects. Cities like Barcelona and Madrid use LoRaWAN for smart parking and environmental sensing. Spanish telecoms (Telef\xf3nica, Everynet in partnership) have nationwide LoRaWAN coverage. |\\n| Australia | Strong adoption in mining and agriculture. Several regional networks cover farming areas (for water tank monitoring, cattle tracking). The national science agency CSIRO has trialed LoRaWAN for environmental monitoring in the outback due to its long range. Major cities have community LoRaWAN coverage via The Things Network. |\\n\\n(Note: The above table highlights a few examples; LoRaWAN is present in many more countries worldwide, often with multiple networks per country.)\\n\\n## Major Use Cases and Industries\\n\\nLoRaWAN\u2019s versatility and low operating cost have led to its use across a wide range of industries. The LoRa Alliance identifies six key vertical domains driving LoRaWAN adoption: Smart Agriculture, Smart Buildings, Smart Cities, Smart Industry (manufacturing), Smart Logistics, and Smart Utilities\u200b. In each of these, LoRaWAN enables new IoT solutions that were previously impractical with shorter-range or higher-power networks. Below we outline these major use cases and examples:\\n\\n### Smart Utilities (Water/Gas/Electric Metering): \\n\\nUtility metering is a flagship LoRaWAN application. Utilities deploy LoRaWAN-enabled smart water meters and gas meters to collect readings remotely over long distances. The long battery life (often 10+ years) of LoRaWAN meters and deep indoor penetration make it ideal for this use. For example, cities in France are rolling out millions of LoRaWAN water meters to automate usage readings and detect leaks in real-time\u200b. \\n\\nIn Spain, LoRaWAN is used by utilities for gas meter monitoring (replacing manual monthly checks). Electricity grid operators also use LoRaWAN for grid telemetry in some regions. [The ROI is significant](https://www.digi.com/blog/post/calculating-roi-for-lorawan-deployments) \u2013 automated meter reading saves labor and can reduce water loss by early leak detection, yielding economic and environmental benefits. Utilities also use LoRaWAN for smart grid sensors (e.g. monitoring distribution transformers or pole top monitors in electric networks).\\n\\n### Smart Cities: \\n\\nUrban deployments of LoRaWAN cover a broad array of smart city services. Street lighting control is commonly done via LoRaWAN nodes that allow dimming schedules and maintenance alerts (achieving energy savings for municipalities). Smart parking systems use LoRa sensors embedded in parking spots to relay availability, reducing traffic congestion. \\n\\nCities like Los Angeles, Amsterdam, and Singapore have trialed such solutions. Waste management is another use: LoRaWAN bin sensors report fill levels so that trash collection routes can be optimized (as done in cities in Belgium and Australia). Environmental monitoring is also crucial \u2013 many cities deploy LoRaWAN air quality sensors and noise sensors on street poles to gather hyperlocal pollution data. \\n\\nThe cost-effectiveness of LoRaWAN (no monthly SIM fees, one gateway can cover a whole district) makes these city-wide sensor networks feasible within municipal budgets. [There are numerous examples globally of cities achieving strong ROI](https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/internet-of-things/simplifying-the-smart-city) and improved services with LoRaWAN deployments in lighting, parking, and waste management (e.g., improved parking fee collection, lower energy bills, etc.)\u200b. LoRaWAN\u2019s presence in smart cities continues to grow as part of \u201cSmart City\u201d initiatives.\\n\\n### Smart Agriculture: \\n\\nAgriculture and farming benefit from LoRaWAN by enabling IoT in fields far from cellular coverage. Soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and crop health sensors with LoRaWAN connectivity help farmers do precision agriculture \u2013 irrigating only when needed, optimizing fertilizer use, and monitoring microclimates. LoRaWAN collars or tags on livestock (cattle, sheep) enable ranchers to track animal location and health across large pastures. \\n\\nIn Australia and the US, [ranchers use LoRaWAN to get alerts if cattle wander or if water levels in remote tanks are low](https://www.ndsu.edu/agriculture/extension/publications/basics-lora-technology-crop-and-livestock-management). These devices run on small batteries or solar and can transmit miles to the nearest gateway. The economic impact is notable: improved yields and reduced resource waste. \\n\\nIn wine regions (like California and Italy), vineyards use LoRaWAN sensors to monitor soil and vine conditions, leading to better crop management. Asia-Pacific\u2019s fast LoRaWAN growth is partly due to agricultural use in countries like India and Indonesia, where rural connectivity is crucial\u200b. The ability to cover large, remote areas with minimal infrastructure (just a few gateways covering thousands of acres) is a unique advantage of LoRaWAN in this sector.\\n\\n### Logistics and Asset Tracking: \\n\\nLoRaWAN is increasingly used for tracking assets that move through supply chains or within large facilities. LoRaWAN asset trackers (small battery-powered GPS or BLE-enabled tags) can be placed on pallets, containers, or equipment. They periodically send their location (or sensor data like temperature for cold-chain monitoring) to nearby LoRaWAN gateways. Logistics providers utilize LoRaWAN at ports and warehouses to track containers without needing cellular on each device. The range allows coverage of entire shipping yards with one gateway. \\n\\nFor cross-country or international tracking, LoRaWAN can be combined with satellite connectivity \u2013 for instance, a container tracker might use LoRaWAN to talk to a small satellite modem which then sends data back to the cloud\u200b. \\n\\nCompanies have reported improved inventory management and theft reduction by using LoRaWAN trackers on high-value assets. In airports, luggage carts and equipment are tracked via private LoRaWAN networks (e.g. [Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam deployed a LoRaWAN network](https://www.iotm2mcouncil.org/iot-library/news/smart-building-construction-news/kerlink-flies-lora-network-at-schiphol-airport/) for asset tracking over its campus\u200b). The logistics sector values LoRaWAN for its low power (trackers can last years on a battery) and its ability to penetrate indoor areas like warehouses or basements where GPS alone fails.\\n\\n### Industrial IoT (Smart Industry): \\n\\nManufacturing plants and industrial sites use LoRaWAN for wireless monitoring of equipment and environment. Predictive maintenance is a key use: LoRaWAN vibration or temperature sensors on machines can regularly report data to predict failures. Because running cables in factories is expensive and Wi-Fi may not cover large sites, LoRaWAN provides a reliable, low-cost wireless backbone for these sensors. Safety monitoring is another aspect \u2013 LoRaWAN can connect gas leak detectors, fire alarms, or worker safety wearables throughout facilities. \\n\\nIn oil and gas fields, [LoRaWAN connects pressure sensors and valve monitors](https://lora-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/LoRaWAN-OIl-Gas.pdf) over wide areas. The manufacturing sector is projected to account for about 28% of LoRaWAN\u2019s market in 2024\u200b, underlining how important industrial use is. By retrofitting factories with LoRaWAN sensors, operators can reduce downtime (through early fault detection) and optimize processes, which has direct financial benefits. \\n\\nA factory might [use LoRaWAN energy meters on equipment](https://akenza.io/blog/retrofitting-energy-meters-with-lora) to identify power hogs and cut electricity costs \u2013 a simple IoT retrofit made feasible by the ease of LoRaWAN wireless deployment.\\n\\n### Smart Buildings: \\n\\nIn commercial real estate and facility management, LoRaWAN is used to make buildings \u201csmart\u201d at a low cost. Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are instrumented with LoRaWAN temperature and humidity sensors in different rooms to optimize climate control. Occupancy sensors and people counters using LoRaWAN help manage meeting room usage or lighting (lights can be automated to turn off when areas are unoccupied). Indoor air quality sensors (for CO\u2082, VOCs) on LoRaWAN are deployed in offices and schools to ensure healthy ventilation. \\n\\n:::tip Want to build your own LoRaWAN dashboard?\\nCheck out our [MetSci Demo Dashboard](/docs/tutorial-extras/metsci-demo-dash) to learn how to build a custom dashboard for monitoring your LoRaWAN sensors.\\n:::\\n\\nBuilding managers increasingly adopt LoRaWAN because a single gateway per building can connect hundreds of sensors through walls on multiple floors \u2013 something hard to do with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. \\n\\nLoRaWAN also excels in connecting [elevator or basement equipment monitoring](https://lora-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/LA_WhitePaper_BACnet_1021_Final.pdf) that might be out of normal network range. The result is improved energy efficiency (some smart buildings report double-digit percentage reductions in energy use) and better facility utilization. With new LoRaWAN 2.4 GHz options and emerging standards, even more consumer and building devices might integrate LoRaWAN, and this domain is expected to grow.\\n\\nAcross all these sectors, LoRaWAN\u2019s common value proposition is enabling data collection from many distributed points at low cost, with devices that can run for years on a battery. This has led to significant economic impacts: cost savings (e.g. in meter reading and maintenance), new revenue streams (IoT services offered by operators), and improved outcomes (e.g. higher crop yields, reduced city traffic). \\n\\nAs an illustration, [a study of LoRaWAN in precision agriculture](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772375522000181) might find yield improvements of 5-10% for certain crops due to better irrigation control \u2013 which is economically very significant for farmers. In cities, smarter lighting can cut electricity costs by 30-50% in streetlight operations. While exact ROI varies by project, many markets are seeing high ROI from LoRaWAN deployments, which drives further investment. The collaborative ecosystem (sensor makers, network providers, software platforms) lowers barriers for new solutions, accelerating IoT innovation.\\n\\n## Emerging Trends and Future Outlook\\n\\nThe global LoRaWAN industry continues to evolve with new trends that will shape its future trajectory:\\n\\n### Satellite-Enabled LoRaWAN: \\n\\nOne of the most exciting developments is the expansion of LoRaWAN beyond terrestrial limits via satellite connectivity. Starting around 2020, several companies have launched low-earth-orbit satellites equipped to forward LoRaWAN messages\u200b. This effectively creates a space-based LoRaWAN layer for truly global coverage \u2013 reaching remote oil rigs, ocean buoys, wildlife trackers, or any sensor outside of cell range. By 2022, early LoRaWAN satellite services (from firms like Lacuna, EchoStar, and Fossa) were in testing, and by 2023 some became commercially available. \\n\\nThis trend means LoRaWAN could unify terrestrial and satellite IoT on one standard, which is a unique advantage (NB-IoT and others are also pursuing satellite integration, but LoRa\u2019s low power makes it well-suited to burst data to satellites). We can expect growth in hybrid devices that use terrestrial LoRaWAN when available and satellite when not, especially for asset tracking across land/sea and environmental monitoring in remote regions\u200b.\\n\\n### Community and Decentralized Networks: \\n\\n**Helium\u2019s*** model of a decentralized, blockchain-incentivized LoRaWAN network sparked interest in new business models. By rewarding individuals for deploying coverage, Helium rapidly scaled the number of LoRaWAN gateways worldwide\u200b. While the long-term viability of the crypto incentive is still evolving, the concept of community-driven networks is here to stay. \\n\\nOther initiatives and community networks (like The Things Network community and regional IoT cooperatives) continue to expand coverage in areas perhaps underserved by traditional telcos. This trend could lead to a patchwork of public, private, and community networks that interoperate. \\n\\nThe LoRa Alliance is fostering roaming and data exchange between networks via standards like LoRaWAN roaming and the [Packet Broker](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/concepts/packet-broker/)\u200b, so that a device might seamlessly use any available LoRaWAN gateway regardless of owner. The blending of public, private, and community networks is a trend that increases overall coverage and resilience of the LoRaWAN ecosystem.\\n\\nConvergence with 5G and Cellular IoT: Rather than viewing cellular IoT (NB-IoT/LTE-M) and LoRaWAN as purely competitors, the industry is exploring synergies. Hybrid solutions are emerging where LoRaWAN handles local low-power sensor data, and cellular or 5G backhaul carries aggregated data. For example, some gateway devices combine LoRaWAN and 4G/5G modems to forward data from LoRa sensors to cloud services. \\n\\nThere are also cases of operators [integrating LoRaWAN into their 5G networks as a slice](https://univ-rennes.hal.science/hal-04239515/file/Jradi%20et%20al-2023-A%20Seamless%20Integration%20Solution%20for%20LoRaWAN%20Into%205G%20System.pdf) or offering managed LoRaWAN service along with NB-IoT. The fact that LoRaWAN leads in private networks has inspired the 5G community to develop private 5G/NR solutions \u2013 but those remain costly and power-hungry for many IoT needs. \\n\\nWe are likely to see LoRaWAN continue to fill the niche for ultra-low-power, long-range sensing even in a 5G world, often working in tandem with high-bandwidth technologies (e.g., using LoRaWAN for short messages and 5G for video or large data when needed). Semtech\u2019s recent collaborations (e.g., with TTI and AWS) also indicate an effort to simplify IoT by uniting LoRaWAN connectivity with cloud platforms for device management\u200b.\\n\\n## Growth of LoRaWAN Ecosystem and New Standards: \\n\\nThe LoRaWAN ecosystem is maturing, with over 500 members in the LoRa Alliance and a proliferation of certified devices. Interoperability and certification ensure that sensors and gateways from different vendors work together, which will remain a focus. \\n\\nAs the ecosystem grows, we see new profiles (like LoRaWAN for smart homes, which might require interoperability with consumer IoT standards) and possibly lightweight versions for simpler devices. Also notable is the [emergence of LoRaWAN in the 2.4 GHz band](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614081) (a globally available ISM band). \\n\\nWhile most LoRaWAN today operates in sub-GHz regional bands, 2.4GHz LoRaWAN could allow a single device model to be used worldwide (trading off some range). This could open LoRaWAN to new consumer applications or worldwide logistics tracking without regional SKUs. The alliance-driven approach of LoRaWAN has been highlighted as a key to its success, and even other LPWAN groups (Wi-SUN, mioty) are following similar multi-stakeholder models\u200b. \\n\\nWe can expect the Alliance to continue updating the standard (security enhancements, support for new frequency regulations, etc.) and driving collaborations (e.g., liaison with 3GPP for coexistence, with Wi-SUN alliance, etc.).\\n\\n### Higher Density and Scalability Solutions: \\n\\nAs LoRaWAN networks grow from a handful of gateways to thousands (especially in dense urban deployments or massive industrial complexes), managing interference and capacity is a challenge. The industry is working on network optimization techniques like dynamic channel plans, interference mitigation, and perhaps future revisions of the protocol to allow even greater device densities. \\n\\nResearch and field experience are defining the limits of LoRaWAN capacity and how to push them (some studies show tens of thousands of devices can coexist per gateway under proper configurations). The introduction of repeating/relay nodes (an optional new feature) can extend range in tough radio environments, though with careful duty cycle management. All these efforts aim to ensure LoRaWAN can scale to the billions of devices projected in coming years.\\n\\n### Economic Impact and ROI Focus: \\n\\nAs deployments scale, customers are increasingly measuring the direct economic impact of LoRaWAN solutions. This feedback loop influences the market by highlighting successful applications. For example, if a city reports that its LoRaWAN smart lighting project paid for itself in energy savings within two years, other cities will quickly follow. \\n\\nWe are seeing such ROI-positive case studies accumulate in domains like smart metering (where utilities see reduced operating costs and improved revenue assurance by catching leaks/theft), cold chain monitoring (preventing spoilage of food or vaccines), and predictive maintenance (avoiding costly downtime in factories). These demonstrated successes drive further investment in LoRaWAN projects. \\n\\nIndustry analysts note that LoRaWAN\u2019s multi-year head start in real-world deployments has [given it a credibility and \u201cproof of concept\u201d](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2024/10/21/The%20IoT%20of%20Things%20Oct%202024%20508%20FINAL_1.pdf) library that newer technologies lack\u200b. Consequently, the market is reaching a tipping point where IoT solution buyers trust LoRaWAN as a stable, cost-effective choice with proven outcomes, which should sustain its growth.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the global LoRaWAN industry has moved into a phase of mass adoption and diversification. Key players from startup innovators to telecom giants are collectively strengthening the ecosystem. \\n\\nThe technology has a rich history from 2009 to now, evolving from a French lab idea to an ITU-recognized international standard. When compared to other LPWANs, LoRaWAN stands out for its global community and flexibility, which has translated into it leading in most markets outside of China. \\n\\nThe market analysis shows healthy growth across continents, with particularly strong investment in Europe and North America and rapid expansion in Asia and beyond. LoRaWAN\u2019s use cases now cover virtually every industry that needs IoT, delivering tangible benefits and ROI in each. \\n\\nThe data and trends indicate a robust trajectory: estimates of billions of LoRaWAN devices in the next decade\u200b and continued innovation (like satellite LoRaWAN and new standards) suggest that LoRaWAN will remain a cornerstone of the IoT landscape. Its ability to provide low-power, long-range connectivity at low cost addresses a fundamental IoT need, ensuring that the LoRaWAN industry will thrive as the Internet of Things continues its global growth."},{"id":"/2025/02/02/Networked_Synesthesia","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025/02/02/Networked_Synesthesia","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-02-Networked_Synesthesia.md","title":"Networked Synesthesia","description":"Synethesia is when the expereince of one sense triggers another.

We\'re all bathed in sound, but deafness is the inability to translate it into, well, sounds we hear.\\n\\nBy placing vibratory motors through a vest and then translating sounds into a felt experience, the brains of the users \\"livewired\\" themselves to hear sound again.  Pretty rad.\\n\\nDr. Eagleman managed to get that down from a vest to a bracelet with vibratory motors evenly spaced around the bracelet.  Interestingly, where a vibration is felt can be shifted between 2 motors by changing the power of the buzz in each motor.  The stronger the buzz (comparatively), the closer to that motor the sensation is felt.  This effectively gave them way more \\"buzz points\\" which translated into a more granular ability to translate incomin sound waves into signals the brain could use.\\n\\nNow, if you can hear sounds with a bracelet, it\'s reasonable to imagine that you could get a sense of other things, including spatial awareness of where other people are if they\'re transmitting their position.\\n\\nLoRa is a potential excellent wireless protocol for this; it\'s robust, low energy, can be encrypted (or could run through [Reticulum](https://reticulum.network/?) so it\'s definitely encrypted, and long range (that\'s what LoRa is short for).\\n\\nImagine an element of soldiers all wearing a bracelet (or vest, or whatever) who could literally feel where other soldiers in their element were?  \\n\\nObviously this could be used by firefighters and other rescue elements in chaotic situations.\\n\\nBy running this over LoRa (or a LoRaWAN) and integrating Reticulum to use multiple communications protocols and integrate other assets (an overhead drone with a LoRaWAN gateway, for example), you could potentially have an extraordinary advantage over a wide area whenever you need to coordinate human activity.\\n\\nPretty cool use case, eh?

One of the first people to study micrometeorology was a French scientist named Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre. Delambre used instruments like thermometers and barometers to measure temperature and pressure in the atmosphere.\\n\\nOther scientists, such as English meteorologist Luke Howard, also contributed to the study of micrometeorology. Howard is known for developing a system for classifying clouds based on their shape and height in the sky. This system is still used today.\\n\\nAs scientists continued to study micrometeorology, they developed more advanced instruments and techniques for measuring the movement of air and other substances near the Earth\u2019s surface. For example, they developed anemometers, which are instruments that measure the speed of the wind, and pyranometers, which measure the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth\u2019s surface.\\n\\nToday, micrometeorology is an important field of study that helps us to understand how the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and surface interact with each other.

For example, when the sun shines on the Earth, it warms the surface and the air close to it. This warm air rises and mixes with the cooler air above it. This mixing helps to even out the temperature between the Earth\u2019s surface and the atmosphere.\\n\\nVegetation, such as trees and plants, can also affect the exchange of heat, moisture, and other substances between the Earth\u2019s surface and the atmosphere. For example, plants release water into the air through a process called transpiration. This helps to cool the air and the surface of the Earth.\\n\\nUrbanization, or the development of cities, can also have an impact on the exchange of heat, moisture, and other substances between the surface and the atmosphere. For example, buildings and other man-made structures can block the sun\u2019s rays and prevent them from warming the surface of the Earth. This can make it harder for the air to mix and can lead to hot and cold spots in the city.\\n\\nOverall, the planetary boundary layer plays a key role in the Earth\u2019s climate and weather.
