LoRaWAN is a type of wireless technology that is used to transmit small amounts of data over long distances. It is often used in sensors that measure things like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

One way that LoRaWAN-based sensors can be used to study the local weather and improve our understanding of the planetary boundary layer is by placing these sensors in different parts of the environment. For example, a farmer might use LoRaWAN sensors to measure the temperature and humidity on their property, or a scientist might use them to study the wind speed and direction at different levels above the Earth’s surface.

By collecting data from these sensors, scientists can get a better understanding of the local weather patterns and how they are influenced by the planetary boundary layer. They can also use this data to improve our understanding of the processes and dynamics of the boundary layer, such as how it mixes and transports heat, moisture, and other substances between the Earth’s surface and the atmosphere.

One of the benefits of using LoRaWAN-based sensors to study the weather is that they can transmit data wirelessly over long distances. This means that scientists can collect data from a large area without having to physically visit each location. It also means that the data can be transmitted in real-time, so scientists can get a more up-to-date understanding of the weather patterns and how they are changing.

Overall, the use of LoRaWAN-based sensors is a useful and efficient way to study the local weather and improve our understanding of the planetary boundary layer. By collecting accurate and reliable data from these sensors, we can learn more about the Earth’s climate and weather patterns and take steps
