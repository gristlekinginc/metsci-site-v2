Back in 2022, Mike Harttree, an IoT Architect at Cisco, [gave a talk at the LoRa Alliance's annual conference](https://youtu.be/Gglwe9sKpCA?si=9IS_YBpHCynIk2dT) about how the U.S. government is using LoRaWAN to enhance operational efficiency and tackle long-standing logistical challenges.  

With all the current fuss about Meshtastic and LoRa, I thought it'd be a good idea to review what has already been done.  Some of this is super basic (replacing fuel stick measurements with digital ones), but after all, that's what IoT is about; digitizing the measurements of our world.  

It doesn't have to be fancy, it just has to work.

**Introduction**  
The U.S. government has begun leveraging LoRaWAN technology to enhance operational efficiency and tackle long-standing logistical challenges. In a recent talk, Cisco's U.S. government IoT engineer detailed how LoRaWAN solutions are addressing critical needs in areas like military aviation and asset tracking. Here's a summary of how LoRaWAN is making an impact.

**Cisco's Role in the LoRaWAN Ecosystem**  
Cisco has positioned itself as a significant player in the LoRaWAN space, with over 480 global customers deploying their gateways, routers, and software. The company's offerings include:  

1. **Industrial Asset Vision**: An all-in-one cloud-based LoRaWAN solution integrating Cisco sensors, gateways, and network servers for seamless deployment.  

2. **Customizable Enterprise Solutions**: Cisco collaborates with Actility and WMW to offer flexible deployments for sensitive use cases, including on-premises Docker-based configurations for government applications.

**Solving Data Sovereignty and Security Challenges**  
In the U.S., government data must comply with strict sovereignty and security regulations, often necessitating that all data remain within national borders. Cisco addresses these requirements by:  

- Deploying Docker containers for network and application servers on government-approved private clouds like AWS GovCloud and Microsoft Azure for secure, localized data processing.  
- Ensuring the solutions meet certifications up to top-secret classification.

**LoRaWAN in Military Aviation**  
Cisco's solutions are being implemented in U.S. military aviation to digitize processes and improve operational readiness. Key insights include:  

- **Aircraft Readiness Challenges**: The U.S. military aims for 80% aircraft readiness, but current rates are well below that for both legacy (F-22) and modern (F-35) fighter jets. LoRaWAN technology helps streamline maintenance and resource allocation.  
- **Fuel Truck Monitoring**: Previously reliant on manual measurements with sticks, jet fuel levels are now digitized with LoRaWAN sensors, ensuring accurate data and reducing errors.  
- **Asset Tracking**: From nitrogen carts to fuel trucks, LoRaWAN devices help locate critical resources and prevent logistical disputes between branches like the Navy and Marines.

**Improving Safety and Efficiency**  
LoRaWAN is also being used to enhance safety and situational awareness:  

- **Tracking Personnel**: Sensors help locate personnel in challenging conditions, such as Marines operating in low visibility.  
- **Monitoring Equipment**: Vehicles, doors, and other assets are being digitized to ensure they are always accounted for.

**Why LoRaWAN is Effective for Government Use Cases**  
Cisco's LoRaWAN deployments for the U.S. government underscore the technology's adaptability and scalability. Its ability to operate on-premises, comply with stringent security standards, and integrate with existing infrastructure makes it an ideal choice for mission-critical applications.

**Takeaways**  
By digitizing processes and providing secure, localized solutions, LoRaWAN is enhancing military readiness, safety, and resource management. As adoption continues to grow, its role in ensuring mission-critical efficiency will only expand.
