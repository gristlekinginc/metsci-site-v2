One of the most important aspects of micrometeorology is the use of measurements to understand and predict how these processes will change over time.  Here are the 8 measurements you'll need to know. <!-- truncate -->

**Temperature:** Temperature is a measure of how hot or cold something is. In micrometeorology, temperature measurements are used to understand how heat is transferred between the air and the ground, and how this affects the local climate. Temperature measurements are usually taken using thermometers, which can be placed in the air or on the ground to measure the temperature at different heights and locations.

**Humidity:** Humidity is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air. In micrometeorology, humidity measurements are used to understand how water is transferred between the air and the ground, and how this affects the local climate. Humidity measurements are usually taken using hygrometers, which can be placed in the air or on the ground to measure the humidity at different heights and locations.

**Wind speed and direction:** Wind is the movement of air across the surface of the Earth. In micrometeorology, wind speed and direction measurements are used to understand how air is moved around by the wind, and how this affects the local climate. Wind speed and direction measurements are usually taken using anemometers and wind vanes, which can be placed in the air or on the ground to measure the wind at different heights and locations.

**Precipitation:** Precipitation is any form of water that falls from the sky, such as rain, snow, or sleet. In micrometeorology, precipitation measurements are used to understand how water is transferred between the air and the ground, and how this affects the local climate. Precipitation measurements are usually taken using rain gauges, which can be placed on the ground to measure the amount of precipitation that falls in a particular location.

**Solar radiation:** Solar radiation is the energy that is emitted by the sun. In micrometeorology, solar radiation measurements are used to understand how the sun’s energy is absorbed and reflected by the Earth’s surface, and how this affects the local climate. Solar radiation measurements are usually taken using pyranometers, which can be placed in the air or on the ground to measure the amount of solar radiation that is received at different heights and locations.

**Evaporation:** Evaporation is the process by which water is converted into water vapor and released into the air. In micrometeorology, evaporation measurements are used to understand how water is transferred between the air and the ground, and how this affects the local climate. Evaporation measurements are usually taken using lysimeters, which can be placed on the ground to measure the amount of water that is lost through evaporation in a particular location.

**Soil moisture:** Soil moisture is the amount of water that is contained in the soil. In micrometeorology, soil moisture measurements are used to understand how water is transferred between the air and the ground, and how this affects the local climate. Soil moisture measurements are usually taken using soil moisture probes, which can be placed in the soil to measure the moisture content at different depths and locations.

These 8 measurements are at the core of what micrometeorology relies on to understand and predict small-scale weather
