LoRaWAN sensors on [Helium](https://www.helium.com/) can be used for an awful lot of things, and in this blog we use AI (plus Nik at MetSci) to write about exploring some of the possible use cases.  

<!-- truncate -->

If this is your first time at the MetSci (short for MeteoScientific) site and you just want to try using things and muddling through, head over to the [Console](https://console.meteoscientific.com/front/login), sign up for an account and get going.

Oh, you actually want to read the blog, and you'd like to know a little more?  Cool!

## Author Stuff

If you see that an author is just MetSci, it's a straight ChatGPT-written piece.  If the author is **also** Nik, you know there was some human redacting.  If it's **only** Nik, it's a fully human-written piece.

You should consider this blog a general exploration of using the Helium LoRaWAN, not an exhaustive resource for every possible application.  Go get 'em, tigers!
