Vernal pools are unique bodies of water that are of great ecological importance, but are often difficult to monitor and study due to their remote locations. LoRaWAN technology, a low-power, wide-area network communication system, presents a valuable solution to this challenge.<!-- truncate -->

A vernal pool is a temporary body of water that typically forms in the spring and dries up in the summer. These pools are home to a variety of plants and animals that are adapted to survive in these unique habitats, many of which are found nowhere else in the world. Vernal pools are considered keystone habitats and are critical to the survival of many threatened and endangered species.

Tracking the water levels of vernal pools is important for understanding how these pools are changing over time and what impact this might have on the plants and animals that live there. It also helps in managing these pools for human use and understanding how climate change is affecting these pools. However, monitoring vernal pools can be challenging due to their remote and inaccessible locations.

This is where LoRaWAN technology comes in. LoRaWAN is a low-power, wide-area network communication system that allows for remote monitoring of water levels in vernal pools. The system uses sensors to collect data on water levels, which is then transmitted wirelessly to a central location for analysis. The sensors are small, low-power, and long-range, making them ideal for use in remote locations.

In San Diego, conditions are particularly favorable for using LoRaWAN to monitor water levels in our chaparral vernal pools. These pools are located in a semi-arid chaparral ecosystem, which means that they are often subject to prolonged dry periods. This makes it crucial to have accurate water level data in order to understand how these pools are changing over time and how they are being impacted by climate change. Additionally, chaparral vernal pools are also home to several threatened and endangered species, making the monitoring and preservation of these pools particularly important.

LoRaWAN technology presents a valuable solution to the challenge of monitoring remote vernal pools. The technology allows for accurate and reliable data collection in remote locations, which is crucial for understanding how these pools are changing over time and for managing and preserving these unique habitats and the species that depend on them. In San Diego, the conditions are particularly favorable for using LoRaWAN to monitor chaparral vernal pools, and this technology has the potential to play a key role in the conservation and management of these pools in the future.
