## Supporting MetSci
I really appreciate you wanting to support MetSci; it's a fun way for me to help support the community, but it ain't free.  There are 2 ways to do this:

### Buy DC
The easiest way to keep the lights on is to just buy DC via [your Console account](https://console.meteoscientific.com/). You'll get DC to use for your sensors and it helps pay the overhead around here.

If you don't plan on ever using Console but you think this is rad, you could just throw DC straight into the OUI, which keeps the lights on longer. 

### Fund the OUI

[Buy DC online](https://helium.sphere.engineer/) and delegate them to the MetSci **OUI** (Organizational Unit Identifier), which is `197`. You're basically adding DC so I don't have to keep the thing topped up.

Here are the official instructions:
[Delegate DC to An OUI](https://docs.helium.com/iot/run-an-lns/fund-an-oui)
> Note: The MetSci OUI is '197'.

Did it work? Here's the [transaction log on Solscan](https://solscan.io/account/mvKSiNoKNbb1h9qi27GPnpTNfX5qNGsiFcU24ZRgQmY#transfers).
