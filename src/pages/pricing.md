# Pricing
Using the Helium LoRaWAN via the MetSci Console is relatively cheap at **$.0001 per DC**, or Data Credit.  A DC represents 24 bytes, which is small.  You cannot subdivide DC, so if your payload is less than 24 bytes, you'll still pay a DC for it.  

You pay for however much you use; there's no lower limit.  

You can see the incredible riches I'm stacking up at any given time by going to [Helium's Dune Analytics page](https://dune.com/queries/2476191/4073489) and looking for the MeteoScientific in the Known Organization Names.  It's usually under $1/day.  

Multiply that figure by .9 to get my gross profit, then subtract what I pay to Disk91 to run the Console (which, trust me, is more than $1/day by a lot) and you'll see that I more or less run this thing on love and at a loss.

Every so often some rad soul will think what I'm doing is cool and they'll buy a $100 of DC for their account, which makes it a little easier to explain to my wife why I'm running something that is a good deal for everyone else.

Still, I get plenty of benefit out of running this thing, most of which is just direct hands-on "how does this work" that is equal or greater in value to the monetary loss I usually incur on MetSci.

A final note on pricing:  This whole thing rests on a blockchain project called Helium.  In order to use Helium, you have to buy DC, or Data Credits.  Once you buy them, you CANNOT convert, trade, swap, or do anything with them but use them.  Those aren't my rules, it's just how it works.
