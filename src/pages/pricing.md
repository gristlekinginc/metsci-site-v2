# Pricing
Using the Helium LoRaWAN via the MetSci Console is relatively cheap at **$.0001 per DC**, or Data Credit.  A DC represents 24 bytes, which is small.  You cannot subdivide DC, so if your payload is less than 24 bytes, you'll still pay a DC for it.  

You pay for however much data you use; there's no minimum fee.  However...

## Pay Up Front
Ya pay up front, and you can't get anything back.   This whole thing rests on a blockchain project called Helium.  In order to use Helium, you have to buy DC, or Data Credits.  Once you buy them, you CANNOT convert, trade, swap, or do anything with them but use them.  Those aren't my rules, it's just how it works.

## Wealth Beyond Measure
You can see the incredible riches I'm stacking up at any given time by using [Helium's Dune Analytics, embedded below,](https://dune.com/queries/2476191/4073489) and looking for the MeteoScientific in the Known Organization Names.  It's usually under $2/day.

## Data Is The New Oil...

As you may have figured out, the value is typically not in the **raw** data, it's what you do with it.  That's what the rest of the site and my work with MeteoScientific is about; helping YOU make the most out of your data.

Let's crush!
