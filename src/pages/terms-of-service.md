# Terms of Service for MeteoScientific and Related Sites

_Last updated: May 8, 2025_

Welcome to MeteoScientific, a project by Gristle King Inc. These Terms explain what you can expect when using our website and services, including any subdomains like `console.meteoscientific.com` and `metsci.show`.

## 1. What We Offer

MeteoScientific is a platform for learning, experimenting, and exploring how LoRaWAN works in the real world. We provide tools, insights, and educational materials — some of which may require signing up or creating an account.

Everything is offered on a **best effort** basis. That means while we aim for uptime and reliability, sometimes things break. If they do, we’ll try to fix them quickly.

## 2. Responsible Use

We ask that you use this site responsibly. That includes:

- Not attempting to access parts of the system you weren’t given access to  
- Not using the site for illegal or abusive purposes  
- Not misrepresenting yourself or impersonating anyone  
- Not interfering with the experience of other users

## 3. Email Communication

If you choose to sign up for emails, newsletters, or notifications, here’s what you can expect:

- You’ll only receive messages **you explicitly opted in for**  
- You can unsubscribe **at any time** with a single click  
- We do **not buy, sell, rent, or scrape** email lists  
- We keep track of how and when you opted in, to respect your preferences and privacy

We may occasionally send updates, tips, or new feature announcements related to LoRaWAN or MeteoScientific. All messages come directly from us — not from third parties.

## 4. Your Data & Privacy

We take your privacy seriously. Data you provide is used only to improve your experience and deliver the services you signed up for. For full details, check our [Privacy Policy](https://www.meteoscientific.com/privacy-policy).

## 5. Intellectual Property

Unless otherwise noted, all content on this site belongs to Gristle King Inc. Please don’t copy or reuse anything without permission.

## 6. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms occasionally. The most recent version is always available at [www.meteoscientific.com](https://www.meteoscientific.com). By continuing to use the site, you agree to the current terms.
