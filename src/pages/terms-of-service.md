# Terms of Service for MeteoScientific and Our Related Sites

_Last updated: May 8, 2025_

Thanks for visiting MeteoScientific, a project by Gristle King Inc. By using this website or any of our subdomains (like `console.meteoscientific.com` or `metsci.show`), you’re agreeing to the terms below. We keep things simple, but there are a few important points to cover.

## 1. Using Our Services

We work hard to provide great tools, useful insights, and a smooth experience. That said, our services are offered on a **best-effort basis**. Sometimes things may go down, glitch, or otherwise behave like imperfect software. We appreciate your patience if that happens.

## 2. Being a Good Digital Citizen

We expect all users to act responsibly and respectfully when using our sites or services. That means:

- **No spam.** If you use any of our email tools or receive emails from us, you’ll only get messages you signed up for. We don’t rent, buy, or scrape email lists — and neither should you.
- **Clear consent.** If you subscribe to something from us, it’s because you actively chose to. We don’t pre-check boxes or sneak in subscriptions. If you’re sending emails through our tools, your recipients must have clearly and explicitly opted in.
- **Easy unsubscribes.** Every promotional email we send includes a clear unsubscribe link. If you want out, one click and you’re off the list.
- **No shady behavior.** Don’t misrepresent who you are, try to break into things, or share anything illegal, abusive, or misleading.

We reserve the right to suspend or remove access to our tools or platform if someone’s using them in ways that go against these principles.

## 3. Email Quality Standards

We use email responsibly — both for our messages and for any features we provide that help you send emails. We monitor key delivery metrics (like bounce rates, spam complaints, and unsubscribes) to protect our reputation and yours. If you’re sending emails through us, we expect you to:

- Only email people who **clearly gave permission**  
- Keep your unsubscribe link working and easy to find  
- Accurately identify yourself in the "From" and "Reply-To" fields  
- Avoid using third-party or bought email lists

If these standards aren’t followed, we may limit or revoke email-sending access to keep things running smoothly for everyone.

## 4. Ownership & Rights

Everything you see here — the words, code, branding, and design — belongs to Gristle King Inc. or to the people who gave us permission to use it. Don’t reuse our stuff without asking.

## 5. When Things Change

We may update these Terms from time to time. If you keep using the site after we’ve made changes, that means you accept the new terms.
