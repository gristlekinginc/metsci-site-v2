# About
MeteoScientific is a place I combine my love of technology, the wild, and adventure, then share the useful bits. 

Iâ€™m particularly interested in the weather as it seems to get me into the wildest places, but I'll have just as much fun getting hot 'n sweaty while sensoring up a storage unit or learning about how multi-modal data fusion improves accuracy in pollution monitoring.  The interaction of tech and the real world is rad to me.

As part of MetSci, I run a Helium LoRaWAN [console](https://console.meteoscientific.com/front/login) that is permissionless and relatively cheap for normal people to use.  If you want to give it a whirl your first few data packets are free, which is enough to get an idea of how the whole system works the best way; by gettin' your hands dirty.

Enjoy!
