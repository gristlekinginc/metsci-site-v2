# About
MeteoScientific is a place I combine my love of technology with physical exploration and share that with the world. 

I'm particularly interested in the weather as it seems to get me into the wildest places, but I'll have just as much fun getting hot 'n sweaty pushing a tracked sled around the neighborhood or helping a local business monitor parking, learning about how multi-modal data fusion improves accuracy in pollution monitoring.  The interaction of tech and the real world is rad to me.

As part of MetSci, I run a Helium LoRaWAN [console](https://console.meteoscientific.com/front/login) that is permissionless and cheap to use.  If you want to give it a whirl your first few data packets are free (as in, a year's worth of data if you send one data point an hour).  If you need help with it, check out the Tutorials section.

I also run a [podcast covering LoRaWAN](https://pod.metsci.show) if you want to hear about how this world works from a ton of pros.

Enjoy!
