# About
Meteo Scientific is a place I combine my love of technology, the wild, and adventure, then sharing the useful bits. Iâ€™m particularly interested in the weather as it seems to get me into the wildest places, but I'll have just as much fun getting hot 'n sweaty while sensoring up a storage unit.

As part of MetSci, I run a [console](https://console.meteoscientific.com/front/login) that is permissionless and relatively cheap for normal people to use.  It's not going to be a plug 'n play thing though; you'll have to like to geek out on technology a little bit in order to learn how to use it.
