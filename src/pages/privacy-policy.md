_Last updated: May 8, 2025_

At MeteoScientific (owned and operated by Gristle King Inc.), we are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and how we keep it safe across all our services, including meteoscientific.com, metsci.show, and any subdomains.

## 1. Information We Collect

Depending on how you interact with our services, we may collect:

- Your name and email address (for example, if you sign up for our newsletter or contact us)
- Email engagement data (such as opens, clicks, and bounces)
- Basic browser and IP information for analytics and diagnostics

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

- Send you transactional or marketing emails

All marketing emails from us include a clear unsubscribe link.

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties, except as needed to process communications through trusted service providers (like Mailgun).

## 3. Data Protection and Security

We use industry-standard tools and protocols, including encryption and access controls, to protect your data. However, please note that no system is 100% secure.
