# Privacy Policy for MeteoScientific and Associated Domains

_Last updated: May 8, 2025_

At MeteoScientific (a project of Gristle King Inc.), we respect your privacy and are committed to keeping your personal information safe. This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and your rights as a visitor or subscriber across meteoscientific.com, metsci.show, and any related subdomains.

## 1. Information We Collect

We only collect what we need to operate and improve our services. That may include:

- Your name and email address (when you sign up or reach out)
- Email engagement data (opens, clicks, bounces — used only for analytics)
- Browser and IP information (for basic diagnostics and analytics)

We do not collect sensitive personal information.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your data to:

- Send you emails you’ve explicitly signed up for (newsletters, updates, etc.)
- Improve how the site performs and how we communicate
- Respond to support or contact requests
- Prevent abuse and protect the integrity of the platform

All marketing or informational emails from us include a clear and functional unsubscribe link. If you unsubscribe, we stop emailing you.

We **never sell, rent, or trade your data**. We only share it with trusted providers (like Mailgun) for essential functions like email delivery. These services follow strict privacy and security standards.

## 3. Data Security

We use standard encryption, authentication, and access controls to keep your data safe. While no system is flawless, we work to minimize risk and respond quickly to any potential issues.

## 4. Your Rights

You have the right to:

- View what data we hold about you
- Correct or update your information
- Request deletion of your data
- Withdraw consent for receiving emails

To exercise any of these rights, reach out via our [Contact page](/contact).

## 5. Third-Party Services

We work with a few trusted partners to help run our services, including:

- **Mailgun** for email delivery
- **Cloudflare** for performance and security

These services only get the data they need to perform their jobs — nothing more.

## 6. Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as our services evolve. If we make meaningful changes, we’ll post them here. Continued use of the site means you’re ok with the latest version.
