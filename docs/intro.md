# MeteoScientific Intro

The point of MeteoScientific is to provide you with a way to learn about and then actually DO stuff using the Helium LoRaWAN.  

The Tutorial - Basics section is more or less a mirror of the YouTube videos transcribed and cleaned up.  it walks you through everything from the basic concepts to getting a device online.

The Tutorial - Extras section is where we take the issues that come up most commonly for people once they've gotten the basics down and see if we can solve them.  Since MetSci is still in the **new & experimental** mode, some of the lessons are still unproven, and represent only a starting point for where to begin.
