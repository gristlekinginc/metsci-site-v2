# Documentation

As you progress further into your MeteoScientific & Chirpstack journey, you'll want to start integrating outside apps so you can actually use your data.

The MeteoScientific Console uses a custom implemented version of **Chirpstack** maintained by Paul Pinault at Disk91.  

For many Chirpstack aspects of the MetSci LNS, you can find [relevant vanilla Chirpstack docs here.](https://www.chirpstack.io/docs/) 

There are, however, more custom aspects, like how to do an HTTP integration, or manage an MQTT integration, or questions about the API.  You can find answers to all of those [here](https://github.com/disk91/helium-chirpstack-community/wiki).

You can always find the docs from your MetSci Console account when logged by going to the top right profile pic and looking in the dropdown menu, like this:

Finally, if you're get totally stuck after banging your head against the docs, swing on by the Gristle King Discord server and ask for help in the `#meteoscientific` channel.  Most of us don't bite and we generally are interested in helping people solve problems.
